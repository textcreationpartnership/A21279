         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>VVhich hath been the cauſe that M. Doctor Ely [à very auncient, vviſe &amp; led<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Prieſte, lyuinge in honour and at his eaſe, far from his natiue ſoile, and farther from all ſuch debate and contention] ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peninge to read that venemous Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gye, could not hold his hande any longer, but quittinge his ovvne repoſe, haſtened to come to ſuccour them, vvhom he (to his great griefe) perceiued, to be verye iniuriouſly ſet vpon and aſſailed.

                  <p>And to ſpeake in differently, vvho is there of our nation that should be ſooner hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened vnto, or better beleeued in this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, then M. D. Ely? For firſt he not beinge partiall, but alike affected vnto both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (as in his Epiſtle folovvinge he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveth at large) hath vvith all indifferency heard, read, and diligently peruſed, vvhat eyther ſide hath to ſay for them ſelues.</p>
                  <p>Then his ſound naturall iudgment, refined and accomplished vvith a profound kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveledg of both ciuill and canon lavve, (vvhereof he hath been publike profeſſor in à famous vniuerſity for many yeares:) inableth him, to diſcerne &amp; ſee on vvho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſide the right is. Finally his ſincere hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, voide off diſſimulation, full of Zeale to

                  <p>VVherefore enery conſiderate an aduiſed reader, muſt needs giue ſingular regard to his opinion, and may vvithout any doubt ſafely relie vpon him, as vpon à moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Authour.</p>

Doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr them from readinge all ſuch bookes as this is. VVhich ſcruple I thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to remooue in this Preface. Becauſe thoſe good felovves that thruſt into their blind folovvers handes, bookes flatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by that Breue, vvith vvarrantiſe: are as earneſt on the other ſide to diſſunde them from touchinge others: leſt readinge them they should eſpie their errours, and ſo for ſake them. Firſt then it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that theſe learned notes of M. D. Ely come not vvithin the compas of the bookes forbidden by the Breue. Bicauſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17035:5"/>they be not vvritten by any of either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to kindle more coales and to increaſe diſcord and debate: but by à charitable, diſcrete and indifferent perſon, to quench the flames of ſtrife &amp; to induceboth ſides to atonement. Againe yf ther vvere ſuch à prohibited booke, yet may they novve be read ſecurely, vvithout incurringe the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of that Breue. For the ſayd Breue vvas not at the firſt receiued and admitted.</p>
                  <p>The one part ſeeinge hovve it vvas abuſed appealinge from it. And the other, to vvitt M. Archprieſt, deludinge and defeatinge of it. For it beinge ſent to vvardes him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome shortly after the 17. of Auguſt, and comning to his hande about Michaelmas, he kept it cloſe and ſuppreſſed it vntill tovvardes the end of Ianuarye folovvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge; that in the meane ſeaſon, the goodly peece of vvorke of their Apologie might be hatched: and then it peepinge out vvith an antidate, might ſeeme to the ſimple, to haue been made before the Breue.</p>
                  <p>VVhat boldnes and preſumption vvas this? Vievvinge his hol. vvill and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, vnder ſo ſeuere a penalty as the greater excommunication, euen hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge his breue in his hande to be ſo auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as at the very noſe of it, to thruſt out bookes ſo opoſite to it, as darkenes is to light, vvas certainly to contemne it in the
<pb facs="tcp:17035:6"/>higheſt degree, &amp; to the greater ſcorne off it, they gaue out, that the breue did onely forbid bookes of our ſide, but admitted all of theirs. It beinge made vvithout partialitye as vvell againſt the one as the other. This vvas the firſt pagea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they plaid againſt it, but vvas this all? Noe. For ſome monethes after both the publishinge off the Breue, and their Apologyes, one in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, and another in English: To the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye and exaſperation of diuerſe ſortes off perſons both Eccleſiaſticall and temporall, there creepeth forth an Appendix to them of the ſame railinge qualitye: vvhich very peartly playeth at bo-peepe vvith his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Breue. The Author confeſſeth ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iouſly, that he had in deed heard of ſuch a breue, but had not ſee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: orels he vvould not for all the good in the vvorld, haue ſo violated it, for vvhat vvilfull contempt should that haue been? and yet the ſeely man vvas ſo ouerſeen, as to relate in the ſame place the ſomme of it, and runninge ouer it orderly as it lieth, to cite certayne ſentences of it AD VERBVM, vvord by vvord. vvhich plainely bevvrayeth his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, and declareth ſufflciently, that he had both ſeen and peruſed the Sayd Breue, but meant to jeſt vvith it. So obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient be they to the ſee Apoſtolike.</p>
                  <p>But I vvould faine knovve vvhat shift

<pb facs="tcp:17035:9"/>hath communicated vnto men. And therefore ſayd this great holy father. MIHI ANTE PRESBITERVM SEDERE NON LICET. It is not lavvefull for me to fit abovve a Prieſt. True it is (as the gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe vpon the former place ſignifieth) that ſince the religious tooke holy orders, an Abbote is to take place afore a ſecular Clearke; but noe other monke or religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. As the ordinary practiſe of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian vvorld in publike proceſſions and all other ſolemne aſſemblies Doth make moſt manifeſt. VVhere the precedence is alvvayes giuen vnto the ſecular. And that theſe sharpe cenſurers take no exception of the vvord MONACHVS, vſed in the former places. and ſay that ſecular Prieſtes be there onely put before monkes, but not before ſuch religious as they are: it is to bee vnderſtood, that in thoſe Authors, MONACHVS, is taken for all ſortes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, for that in thoſe dayes there vvere noe other maner of religious: or yf they vvill needes haue a diſtinction betvven them: then monkes vvilbe the vvorthier, and muſt march before other poore friers, as the ordinary courſe of the vvorld allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveth. And amonge all mendiants, or begginge friers (in vvhich order the Ieſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes recken them ſelues) they are to march in one of the lovveſt ranckes not onely
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17035:9"/>becauſe, their ſocieti is one of the laſt fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but alſo for that they haue fevveſt religious obſeruances; they not beinge bound to rough and rude apparell, oſten and longe faſtes, or continuall riſinge at midnight to Canonicall houres, as other ligious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are the, kepinge onely the eſse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall vovves of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: of vvhich alſo ſome tearme all thoſe that haue not made their laſt profeſſion but tenantes at vvill, and noe freeholders.

All vvhich I ſay, (God is my vvitnis) not to diſgrace any order of the religious, for albeit in the ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ckes of the vvorld they be the lovveſt: Yet in the ſight of God for vvhoſe ſake the leaue all, they may be of the hieſt, yf they excell in vertue: as many good deuoute poore vvoman, shall in the kingedome of heauen, be placed far abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vve many ladies not ſo vertuous as they. Yet as vve giuinge the place to a lady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a poore vvoman here, do not offend God or man: ſo vvhoſoeuer preferreth a ſecular Prieſt afore a religious man, doth not offend againſt Card. Allens graue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, of giuinge them ſuch reuerence as is requiſite to their callinge. Their vocation beinge inferiour to the other, as hath been prooued.

                  <p>And becauſe I am a litle entred into this matter,

                     </note> I vvill to this purpoſe add one ſentence more, out of the next Canon of the ſame queſtion. The ſumme and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance vvhereof is, that it is not lavvefull for monkes and religious to do any thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge (ſpecially belonging vnto the eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall hierarchie), vvithout the counſaile of Prieſtes. Thus taught bleſſed S. Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome 1200. agoe: and this holy charch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed conuenient to be ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged amonge her ſacred decrees. VVhat shall vve then ſay to thoſe vviſemen, vvo leppinge out of the limittes of their ovvne profeſſion, durſt avovve, that Prieſtes vvere out to be truſted vvith the guidinge of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of layfolkes, vnleſſe they depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on ſome religious man. The diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of holy church ſendeth religious for direction and Counſail, vnto ſecular Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes: this vnaduiſed vvriter cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, vvould not haue ſecular prieſtes credited vvith the charge of ſoules, yf they be not ruled by ſome religious: vvhich is alſo ſo much the more abſurd for that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naginge
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17035:10"/>of lay perſons ſpirituall ſaluation apparteyneth moſt properly vnto ſecular Prieſtes, that beinge their peculiar voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and profeſſion. And (as all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,) God moſt aſſuredly aſſiſteth and concurreth, vvith thoſe inſtrumentes, of vvhich he maketh choiſe him ſelf for any purpoſe: novve the very inſtitution of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſtes by our bleſſed Sauiour, vvas to giue them the charge of both conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, inſtructinge, and guidinge mens ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les into the knigedome of heauen: vv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herfore by the diuine lavve of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie prouidence, he doth more ſpecially perfitt this his holy vvorke by the ſeruice of ſecular Prieſtes, then by any other vv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hat ſoeuer. He then that leaueth them, and ſeeketh after others for the directinge of his conſcience, may be reſembled to him that forſaketh the hight vvay, and folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveth bypathes, of vvhich be cannot bee ſo vvell aſſured.</p>
                  <p>For as I take religious men to be the fitteſt to handle religious affaires ſo it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not vvith any colour of reaſon be denied but that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſtes are the moſt proper for the conductinge of ſecular mens conſciences. And therfore I chiefly take them to be <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecular,</hi> for that they liue in the vvorld to be lanternes and guides vnto vvorldly men. VVich should be a ſingular motiue
<pb facs="tcp:17035:11"/>vnto all lay men, to caſt their eyes princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally vpon them and to loue honour, and reſpect them abovve the reſt, as their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Paſtours, vvho haue quitt their ovvne friends and all other thinges to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and dye amonge them, and to aſſiſt them vvhih the vvord of life, and the holy ſacramentes liuinge and dieinge: VVheras the religious (loue they them neuer ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvell) muſt needes forſake them on the ſudden at the commaundement of their Superiours.</p>
                  <p>VVhich I do not relate to Diminiſh in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorte the orderly affection, that any man or vvoman carieth tovvardes them: but to correct the fond opinion of them, that thinke nothing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be vvell done vvith out them. And to complaine a litle of the incongruity of ſuch religious, vvho con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to their rule and profeſſion, plunge them ſelues ouer head and heares into ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical affaires, vvith ſuch audacity and obſtinacy, as they haue tourned all topſie turnie. And hovve can it almoſt be other vviſe ſo longe as they meddle ſo peremtorily in matters, vvherin they haue verie ſmale ſkill: hauinge neither ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died much in the holy canons, by vvhich principally the diſcipline and regiment of the church is directed: nor had any greate practiſe in eccleſiaſticall affaires; they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17035:11"/>as it vvere out of the vvorld, in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincte and far different gouernmente. And finally God doth ſeldome bleſſe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ir enterpriſes vvith good ſucceſſe, vvho runne before he ſend them, and intet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle farther then they haue comiſſion from him or his vicar and vicegerent in earth. VVhefore (to conclude) I moſt hartely requeſt them, to retire them ſelues vvith in their ovvne boundes, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that golden rule, REGVLARIA RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GVLARIBVS, lett religious men deale in matter appertayninge to religion and the cloiſter: and leaue SECVLARIA SECV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LARIBVS.

                  <p>Certayne it is firſt, and there vvell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oued; that the addition of protectour, vnto the title of a Cardinall, vvas impertinent to that purpoſe.

                  <p>The ſecond exception is, for that in the information of the ſayd dd, it vvas related, that the Card: inſtituted that ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, SEQVENS VOLVNTATEM SAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CTISSIMI: VVheras the Apol. averreth it to haue bin done EX SPECIALI MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DATO, by his hol: ſpeciall commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Although he repete this often, and vrge it greatly yet is it a very fiction, vvithout any good ground or probabilitye. For in the Card. his letter of M. Arch.

                  <p>The third exception is that the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers concealed, hovve the ſubordination vvas demaunded by the English Prieſtes: true it is that noe mention vvas made of that, becauſe they knevve it to be moſt fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.

                  <p>Fourthly he excepteth againſt theſe vvordes off the information: <hi>many Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes refuſed to ſubſcribe vnto that ſubordination: vvhen</hi> (as he ſignifieth) <hi>there vvere ſcarce ten that refuſed ſo to doe:</hi> VVhat voluntary le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge is this? they knevve full vvell, That D.

                  <p>But to ſtand avvhile vpon this Breue: It may firſt be doubted, vvhether there be any ſuch or noe, it is ſo diuerſely repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This Apologiſt (as you haue heard)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17035:21"/>Maketh it to prohibite all Englishmen to proceed either bacchelor or Doctor in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity. The Copie reherſed in the former notes, ſaith nothinge of Bacehelars yet forbiddeth not onely Doctors in diuinity, but d. alſo in one of the lavves. A third (vvho ſuppoſeth he ſavve the originall it ſelf vvith the ſeale at it) affirmeth that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bacchelars in diuinity, nor Doctors in any of the lavves, but onely Doctors in diuinity are prohibited to proceed. Of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rumors that runn againſt licenciates I vvill not ſpeake, becauſe they haue no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hedd: but to vvhether of theſe three opinions, vvhich all come from the ſame fountayne muſt vve giue credite? or vntill there be better agreement about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may vve not very vvell (for feare off doeinge vvronge to the reſt) beleeue noe one of them? but rather ſuſpend our iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtay vntill vve shall ſee (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the lavve and Common practiſe of the vvorld) a Canonicall publication and reception of that Breue, in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Countrie, vvhere vve liue, and that ſo much the more in the Caſe of this Breue, as it ſeemeth to haue been obtained by ſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. Heare the preface of it: <hi>Foras much as diuerſe yonge men goeinge from the Colledges took by the vvay the degree of Doctor in diuinity: VVhere vpon Cominge into England, and there
<pb facs="tcp:17035:22"/>takinge their place, accordinge to their degree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many auncient graue Prieſtes, great diſorder did enſue &amp; cet.</hi> This is the preamble in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, vvherein are tvvo falſehoods: the one that many yonge men had proceeded dd. on the vvay: vvhen one or tvvo at the moſt had ſo done, vvho for their ripe knovvleage in ſcholediuinity, vvere eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vvorthy that degree. The ſecond vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueth is, that any ſuch diſorder grevve of it in England: vvhere no graduat lightly doth take his place, Prieſtes ſeldome meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nige togither, and then in diſguiſed habits. Againe yf a yonge graduat, should take pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce before an elder man, yea better learned too then him ſelf: that vvould not bread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſorder. The Common Cuſtome and order of all Chriſtendome beinge, that youger men hauinge taken degree, should be preferred before more aged, not alike qualified. This Breue then beinge graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Vpon vvronge information, let others iudge of the validy of it. Concerninge M. D. Bishope, certaine it is, that he ſeauen or eyeght yeares before that Breue vvas got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, had done all his actes, and had his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce giuen him to proceed Doctor. But not beinge ſo ambitions, (as they vvould ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke men beleeue) ſtayd tenn yeares after his due tyme, before he vvould ſtand in act to take the degree vvhich at lengh he tooke
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17035:22"/>beinge firſt by decree compelled to make his aboad in the ſame vniuerſity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could nor vvithout his diſgrace and great hinderance, put it of any longer. He then alſo to avoid braulinge and all colour of contempt, requeſted the Rectors Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as the Breue goeth: but beinge vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſt iuſt Cauſe refuſed, letted not to take the degree, folovving the beſt counſell in the vniuerſity and citty: firſt for that he had, more then ſeauen yeares before the date of that Breue, taken ſome of the moſt ſubſtantiall pointes, of Doctor Shipp: his exerciſes beinge all made, and his grace graunted: vvherfore ſuch a penall decree as the Breue is, beinge to be reſtrained as much as may bee, can take no hold on him, that vvas ſo far paſſed into the degree before. Secondly for that this Breue vvas neuer published, much leſſe receyued in France, vvhere he remained: and accordin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge to a very probable opinion (vvhich by all learned mens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent, may in practiſe be follovved, vvithout all perill of offence:) a decree made at Rome, and not publis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed canonically in others countryes, hath noe force there, nor bindeth any man in that place. Thirdly noe humane lavve bringeth any obligation in conſcience vv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen it is manifeſt, that the principall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, for vvhich it vvas made ceeſſeth,
<pb facs="tcp:17035:23"/>vvhich is to be gathered out of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme that in this Breue is, to debarr y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onge men from proceedinge. Vpon their departure from the Colledges, before they haue ſtudied foure yeares after in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vniuerſity, novve this cauſe vvholy ceſſed in D. By. Caſe. For from his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fro the Colledg of Rome, vnto the tyme of his proceedinge: VVas litle leſſ then tvventy yeares: and he had ten ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ares before the taking of the degree, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died almoſt ſix yeares in the noble vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Paris, and venerable Faculty of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone. So that it could not be any meanin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of the Authour of the Breue (yf any ſuch be) to lett his proceedinge. yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a petty addition in the end of the Breue (vvhich for his aduantage, this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt vvould make the onely clauſe) he did (to preuente all exceptions) aſk leaue of F. Perſons: VVho vvas then Rector, the vvich at that tyme he refuſed to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, yet about ayeare after, not ſpoken to about that matter, offred it of his ovvne accord, and cauſed, both the protectors &amp; his holines, to ratify, confirme it, yf it neaded any ſuch rehabilitation: as F. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ovvne letters of the 28. of Iuly 1601. to the ſaid Doctor doe teſtifie. Mary all this courteſy vvas after he had laboured vnder hand vvhat he could, to haue the ſaid Doctorship called in queſtion as it is very
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17035:23"/>credibly reported. VVhich might be the cauſe vvhy this Apologiſt, hauing taken to taske to ſtirr in all matters that ſound ill in his eares vvould not lett this paſſe, vvith out giuinge it one dashe vvith his blottin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge penne.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:17035:24"/>to faile him that to no purpoſe laid dovvne at large ſuch impertinent letters. Touchinge the letter from douay, and that of D.

                  <p>Of theſe Queſtions, vvith their anſvveres I collect and gather tvvo thinges. Firſt that it is à palpable vntrueth that D.

                  <p>Secondy by theſe and ſuch like ioly Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, is iuſtyfied that vvhich D. By: ſayd in his letter, that many vaine impertinent Queſtions vvere asked them: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, vvas it not fond, to demaund of them, vvhom they knevve to enter into a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter longe after others, vvho vvas the very firſt that motioned it? but it paſſeth all vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedome and folly, to aſk meſſengers vpon their oathes, vvhy choiſe vvas made off them, before all others, for that meſſage: as though they could enter in to the ſecretes of other mens hartes, and did ſe their hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den counſailes. yf no Princes Ambaſſadors comiſſion, should be allovved, before they

Theſe and ſuch like peeuish intertogatoryes D. By: taxed vpon great reaſon. And did not vvrite (as the Apol: falſely chargeth him,) that he vvas not examined at all, vpon any ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall pointe of their meſſage: but he ſaid that thoſe materiall pointes vvere barely and nakedly taken vvithout there proofes and perſuaſions:

But pardon him I pray you, for it vvas for à good end. For vvhat good end muſt he needs lye in that ſorte? Mary to proue thoſe tvvo Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to haue diſaggreed in their matters. For M: Charnock vvould haue ſuch boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17035:29"/>prohibited. But D. By. did not like that pointe. Yf they agreed in the other more materiall pointes, it imported the leſſe. But D. By: beinge aſked about that, ſaith that he remembreth not, that he vvas exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereon, nor knovveth not vvhy he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>should. But in priuate talke he might haue ſaid, that he knevve ſome in England vvho liked of that booke of titles, becauſe it opened very particularly the ſtate of that high Queſtion. For that pointe [he ſaith] the booke vvas liked, but for many other reſpectes, he affirmeth it to bee much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked, and chiefely for tvvo of very greate vveight. VVherof one is in the former parte of that diſcourſe, of the peoples po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vver ouer their Princes, vvhich if it be not very vvarely read and diſcreetly vnders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tood, is a moſt perillous and peſtiferous peece of doctrine. The other tovvardes the end of the later: VVhere his lavvier ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge argued at large of ſeauen or eight ſeuerall houſes, pretendinge right to the crovvne after her maieſtye, &amp; [like a good contry man] blemished moſt of them bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vvith in the realme, vvith baſtardye, he neuertheles concludeth very grauely, and like à ſound lavvier, I vvarrant you. That euerye on of their titles is good in lavve: And vvarranteth on his credite, ech pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendor, that he may rightofully put him
<pb facs="tcp:17035:30"/>ſelf in armes, &amp; call his friends about him, to porſue his intereſt. A paradox; and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange aſſertion, that ſo many ſeuerall prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dors, to one and the ſame thinge, can ech one haue lavveful title to the vvhole. And yf after his holy counſell, ſo many should push at the crovvne vvith all their forces, (as vvho vvill not giue the venture for a kingedome, hauinge iuſt claine to it,) it vvould ſett all England together by the eares, and the vvhole country in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion. VVhich perauenture, Might be part of his meaninge, vvho made that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, that vvhiles they vvithin the realme, vvere bickeringe one vvith another, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſtranger might ſtepp in, and conquer them all.

For anſvvere vnto this faire tale, ſee vvhat is ſayd in M. D. By. let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and in the cenſure vpon F. Per. letter. I vvill here repete moſt Briefly and moſt truly, hovve they vvere vſed, and leaue the iudgment of it, vnto the reader: beinge

                  <p>And by interrogatoryes (ſuch as it pleaſed them to propound) they vvere co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to deliuer the meſſage they vvere ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Thus ſtood the caſe vvith them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then before they vvere deliuered, they had ſentence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the city vvithin ten dayes, vvhich reſpite they obtayned to viſite the holy places. One beinge enlarged, tho ther vvas kept ſtyll in the Colledg ſafe, as it vvere in hoſtage off the others good behauiour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode. And not thinkinge that enough, for more ſuerty they lodged the Doctor enlarged vvith D. Haddocke and M. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, that they might looke vnto him for dealinge vvith any body. All this is ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, that noe one iote of it can vvith any honeſty be denied. novve lett the vpright reader determine, both of the forme of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice

                  <p>This is that I had to ſay touchinge tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe pointes, vvherevvith M. D. Byshope ſtandeth charged in the Apology.

But nether then, nor ſince to this houre, vvas ther eyther accuſation off fisher, or any other, by vvorde or vvritin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge obiected againſt me, to proue me to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue knovven of the ſaid memorialls, or to haue meddled vvith the broyles off the English Colledge at Rome.

VVhich aduauntage comenly he and ſome of our English Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts do not vſe to let slippe and ſpeciallye the broyllers, vvhen it is for matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. To be short as the ſaid nuntio tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de me him ſelfe, F. Baldvvin deſired that thoſe differences betvvene Maſter Doctor Gifforde and the Ieſuiſts might be ended. VVherupon they both beinge vvith him, he ſittinge in his chaire and they ſtanding, he tooke one hande of eche of them, and helde them faſt together, F.

The Sayd Nuntio vvrote in particular to Cardinall Cayetan then protector of our nation, hovv theſe matters paſſed, and vve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re accorded. F.

And for that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth me, I do not ſo far dispaire of the acknovvleginge of his errors and faultes, but that yf I might ſpeake vvith him afore indifferent perſons, I vvould make him lay dovvne the truthe of the speaches and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (vvhich vvere verye fevv) that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betvvene him and me, and to shevv that they vvere nothinge in that ſort, and ſence, you giue them out, but vvere verye vvell to be iuſtified afore God, and man, and tendinge to no other ende, but to the aduancement of gods cauſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of ſuch as hinder the ſame.

                  <p>
                     <hi>In Auguſt laſt N. N. (vvho paſſed by you) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing occaſion to goe into Ingland I dealt vvith him to goe dovvne into my countrey to ſee vvhither my friend vveare liuing or no, and to bring me certeine nevves thereof. He ſeeeng theis bookes vpon his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and telling him that they vvere nouellties in the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe contreys, he ſent them to me by him: and ſo rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them in Septembre laſt, vvhen I had read them curſſorely ouer, I threvv then in a corner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thinking to look on them againe (ſo vnpleaſant are contentious bookes vnto me) but hauing receaued this Apologie and conferred them together, I began to perceiue vvhat the grovvnde and ſubſtance vvas of this ſandalous controuerſie, the vvhich before I neglected and cared not for. And findinge this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie to be vvritten rather to augment then to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the contentions, and perceuinge that the others vvent ſimply to vvorke, in ſetting dovvne truly &amp; ſimply the cauſes of theeſe controuerſies, but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologye to flye as from a ſerpent the true cauſes the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof. And beſide ſeeing the chief hedd of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, to depende vpon a pointe of lavve, I could not hold my hand, but vvas driuen in recompence of the booke you ſent me, to ſend you theſe pointes vvherin I mislike the Apologie, and vvherin they
<pb facs="tcp:17035:45"/>ought to haue ſatisfied (as they do not) their frendes and readers. I hope in reading it vvithout affection you shall perceaue vvho thoſe be that</hi> Sibi impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare debent, qui cauſam dederunt, quique illi ſunt, <hi>as you note of our holy Martyr S. Thomas, &amp; vpon them the</hi> vae illis <hi>&amp;c. is like in thend to fall. For my part I miſlike vvith the diſconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted brether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne for one thing, vvith the Ieſuites for</hi> 2. <hi>thinges: vvith the Archpriest for as many: and vvith the Apologie for a great nomber of faults it hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as by this diſcourſe is made euident. VVith the diſcontented priſtes, not for vvriting, for it vvas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for them ſo toe doe, bicauſe it ſtood vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their honor, honeſtie and credite: but for vvritting as they did hardly both of the vvhole ſocietie, and of diuers particular Fathers and prieſts. If they had kept the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues vvith in the compas of their matter in the latin booke to his Hol: as they did in the latin booke to the Inquiſitors: the Apologie maker muſt haue held his peace for any aduantage he could haue had againſt them. The firſt fault of the Fathers vvas, for that they meadled in a matter nothing at all apparteinning to them. For vvhat haue religious men (that haue a distincte bodie, and a diſtinct common vveale, and haue diſtinct Superiors,) to doe vvith an other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and common vveale diſtinct and ſepart from them? VVhat had they to doe vvith the affaires, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations and contentions of ſecular prieſtes? yea
<pb facs="tcp:17035:46"/>vvhat had the Ieſuites more to doe to meadle in it, then the Benedictines, Charterhovvſe Moncks, &amp; Capuchines? of vvhich orders vve haue diuers of our natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as deſirous of, and as zealous for the good of our contrey as the English Fa. can be? Their ſecond fault vvas, in vvritting of that vnlearned and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous booke of ſchiſme againſt the Prieſtes that vvere innocent thereof and farr from the note of ſedition and rebellion, for that vvithſtanding the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſtes inſtitution vpon a Cardinalls letters, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Hol. Bull: as in this diſcourſe is ſufficiently proued. I find not ſo great fault vvith the vvritter (for he might be commanded to doe it) as vvith the Superior for commanding it to be done, and vvhen it vvas done ſo vnadviſedly by his ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to approue it. for our rule in lavve ſaith:</hi> ea no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra facimus quibus noſtra impartimur au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatem. <hi>VVe make thoſe things our ovvne, to the vvhich vve doe impart our aucthoritie.</hi>

                     <hi>One of the ARchprieſtes faultes vvas, for that vvithout iudgement and prudence he ſubſcribed alſo to that booke and by his approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made it as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as he could. His other faulte vvas, his ouer much ſeueritie tovvardes his bretherne: as vvell appeareth by his anſvveres to them laid dovvne in their appeale, and neither checked nor controuled by this Apologie. I might ioyne to this his toſsing of the cenſures vvithout any regard or reuerence.</hi>

                  <p> 
                     <hi>Novv for the faultes of this Apologie, I referre you to that vvhich follovveth. If I haue vvro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged the Authors thereof either in my vvords, or by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking the ſence of theirs, I ſubmitt me ſelf to the iuſt reprehenſion of any learned and vnpaſsionat man vvhoſoeuer, and promiſſe all due and charitable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. And that I my ſelf vvas free from all affection or paſsion vvhen I vvrote it, (except that ſome times I may vtter ſome sharpe vvorde, their fault being ſo euident and exorbitant, that an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell vvould haue dipped his pene in gaule) may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectured, by that I vvas neuer, (as I haue ſaid) of the one faction or th'other: but all vvaie kept me ſelf free and cleare from all paſſion, loving and honoring both ſides and parties as my deare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing vvished and deſired that ſome good peace and appointment might be made amongſt them. Novv for more proof of my neutralitie firſt, I neuer vvrote or ſubſcribed any letter in my life ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the Fathers for the others, nor for the Fa. againſt them, nor euer vvas dealer in any actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pro or con, for either partie. Secondly, there haue paſſed throughe this tovvne men of both ſides, and alſo haue lodged vvith me ſomtimes men of either faction, at one and the ſelf ſame time: The vvhich vvere equally vvellcome vnto me, I gaue them all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaies the like and equall countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, bicauſe I loved them egally, for that they vvere English Prieſts or
<pb facs="tcp:17035:47"/>Catholikes. And for this I referre me to the report of ſuch of either ſide, that haue done me that honor and pleaſure as to viſite me. Laſtly if I could be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall or affected more to one ſide then an other (as in truth I cannot be) there are many reaſons and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, vvhy I should leane rather to the Archprieſt &amp; his ſide, them to th'other. for that I haue many old and deare fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of that ſide, both at home and abrode: to omitt the Archprieſt him ſelf vvith vvhom I haue bene acquainted aboue theeſe</hi> 35. <hi>yeares, as vvell in Oxford, as in Dovvay, and ſince that in Ingland. My brother vvho should be the deareſt to me in this vvorld (as I vndrestand) is of that ſide: So is M. Henry Shavve my oldeſt frend, one of the 6. aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts named by the Card. M. Bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſton, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d M.

Beſids M. Archer (vvhom theſe nicnamed the diſcontented bretherne ſeame egerly to purſue) is my deare frend and godſoon. To omitt a great nombre of my acquaintance that are amongeſt the vnited Prieſt (as they are named) the ſuppoſed Authors of this Apologie. On th'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide I knovv no man vvith vvhom I am fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly acquainted but M. Edvvard Bennett, nor to vvhom I am bound for any benefitt or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie frendshipp receaved, but to M. Bluett, vvho

You may ask me then, hovv chauuce you begine novv to entremeadle, the ſtrife and ſturre being at the vvhotteſt? I anſvvere. If I had neuer ſeene the Apologie, I should neuer haue thought vpon the matter: but ſeeing ſuch fond and foolish matter therin, and by that booke percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the iuſtice of the cauſe of thoſe called diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prieſts, I could not hold my hand I confeſſe, but for your ſake and in recompence of the booke, to ſend you my aduice there vpon, hoping you vvill looke more deeper into the cauſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of it beter and not geve ſuch credit to the Apologie as you ſeeme by your letters to doe, and vvith all to ſee more clealy vvhere the faultes of all theſe ſcandalous and vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable troubles are to be laid, and vvho vvere the firſt occaſioners of it, and after that, the renevvers therof.

                  <p>In the meane tyme, till your other be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſucceede I shall deſire the reader to pervſe this diligently, and to conferre theſe

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt fault I find vvith you (vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bretherne) is that by vvriting of this Apologie, you blovve (as it vvere) the trumpett to an nevv onſett, as men deſirous to continevve in vvrangling and diſſention ſtill, and prouoking your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented brethrene to breake their ſilence, for their ovvne defence: by vvhich doing you haue not only broken Charitie (vvhich in ſuch a nombre as you be, shoulde more abounde, then in a leſſer nomber, not ſo vvell vnited as you are) but alſo highly diſobaied his holines commandement (vvhich diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience you oft obiect in this your Apologie, to your brethrene) vvho in his laſt bull ſent into Ingland for the pacification of theis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, forbadde all bookes vvritten on both ſides, to be read of any vvith in Ingland, or others to be vvritten, vnder paine of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. If you (vnited bretherne) be herein obedient childrene? let all men that haue either ſeene or heard thereof, be Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:17035:75"/>
                  <p> Beſides that, you might very vvell haue ſpared his labour, for you doe nothing in all this your booke, but rove vp and dovvne vvith by and impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t matters, neuer tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching or comminge neare the prick: filling vp your booke novv vvith old quarrells, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining neither to the matter you vvrit of nor to the men you vvrite againſt: then, vvith letters, examinations, and other trifles (as thoſe of M. vvatſons deuiſes) not vvorth the labor (certz) of ſuch men as you are, and much leſſe vvorthe the reading of any vviſe, graue or learned reader as in place shalbe noted.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond fault I find, is vvith the title or inſcription of your firſt chapter (imitating herein your ſelues, vvho find fault vvith the title of the latin booke, but hovv iuſtly, shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be shovved in his place) vvhich you haue put dovvne in generall termes and yet in deed do proue nothing at all of that vvhich you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. So as it may vvell be ſaid of this title, as our Lavviers often times ſay of our Rubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckes, viz, that <hi>Rubrica eſt generalior nigro,</hi> the Rubrick (or title) is more generall and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then the text. yon ſay: The emulation of ſecular priſtes againſt religious: bothe theiſe vvord ſecular priſtes and Religious being put dovvne indefinitly, that is generally, for in lavve <hi>Indeſinitum aequiparatur vniuerſali.</hi> An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite propoſition, is equall to a vniuerſall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17035:76"/>propoſition. So that you ſay thus, (if you ſay any thinge) The emulation of all ſecular prieſtes againſt all ſortes of religious men, hath brought great hurte to Ingland. And all your profes yet are but of ſome ſecular prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, againſt other ſecular prieſts and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue all done, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d come to the pointe of this controuerſie, you grant it is the emulation of 13. prieſtes, (brought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to 7.) againſt their fellow prieſtes, and one Ieſuit. and elswhere you confeſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that this emulation is but of ſomme fewe ſecular prieſtes againſt the fathers.</p>
                  <p>By this generalitie of ſpeach then, you doe not only accuſe your ſelues, (for you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſecular prieſts but do alſo drawe me and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with in the compaſſe of this emulation, who were neuer of the one nor of th' other faction, but haue hitherto and ſo will ſtill kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe our ſelues indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and free, from paſſion or affection to either ſide, in this ſo piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſlanderous diſſention.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching Religious. all this emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is but againſt one order of Religious viz: the fathers of the Society, as you confeſſe throughout the whole booke, and ſo it muſt needes be, bicauſe there are not many in Ingland of any other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Thus then you should haue intitled your chapter: <hi>vvhat great hurt hath come to Jngland by emulation of the laytie againſt the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17035:76"/>and of a fevv ſecular Prieſtes against other ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſtes, and the Religious of the Societie of Iheſus.</hi> For other emulation then this, your doe not proove, either in this chapter, or in the vvhole booke it ſelf: I feare much that the vnited Prieſtes, are not the Authors of this booke, for that I cannot iudge ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them, that to extoll, praiſe, and defend the ſocietie and ſome certaine perſones of the ſame, they vvould ſo farre forgett them ſelues, as to accuſe men of their ovvne coate and order, of ſo hainons a crime, as not only in our daies, but from the beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie in our contrey, the emulation of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prieſtes againſt Religious should bring great hurts to our Nation: Out vpon ſuch baſe Prieſtes, as ſo vniuſtly and vncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, accuſe them ſelues and theirs, to pleaſe others, out vpon ſuch vnnaturall birds, that defile their owne neſtes, by ſlaundering their owne vocation in words without any profs, as anone shalbe shewed.</p>
                  <p>In an other place, to a baſe and bring in to contempt, your owne order and vocation, you ſay: That the greater parte of you were ſerving men, ſouldiers and wandrers. but to be plaine with you, I do not thinck that any ſecular Prieſtes would be ſo iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and vngratfull to this order and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And therfore I thincke ſome reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man hath borrowed your names, the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17035:77"/>better therby to extoll his religion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and to abaſe and bring into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, both with layty and Clergie, the ſtate of ſecular Prieſtes: to thend he may ſo reveng him ſelf, of ſome of them his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and ſo for the fault of afewto offer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury to the reſt. This is no no veltie for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port goeth of a religious man, that borrowed M. Dolmans name, (a ſecular Prieſte in a booke dedicated to the Earle of Eſſex, when he was in his ruffe: the which trick, as it brought that Prieſt, into ſome danger then, ſo this toy is like to bring you (the vnited Prieſtes) into disfavour, miſlick and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, with all well meaning and vnpaſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men, both Prieſtes and lay: to ſee you ſo farre from all love and charitie towards your bretherne, that you are made not only, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to vexe and diſcredite them, but alſo Authors, to renewe, and proclaime the warre a freash againſt them, with fire and ſworde, which will fall out but little to your owne creditt.</p>
                  <p>If you do iuſtly miſlike the diſcontented bretherne, for touching the whole bodie of the Ieſuits, you haue to pardon me, if I miſlike with you in touchinge ſo generally, the body of the ſecular Prieſtes, where of I am a member. But lett vs ſee firſt wherein the ſeculer Prieſtes haue emulated the Religious with ſo great hurt to Ingland? Sure it muſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17035:77"/>be that they envied them, for their lands and livings, for their Iuriſdiction and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or for their liues and behaviours. Now touching the firſt twoe, it is well knowen our ſecular Clergie in Ingland, to haue had ſuch honorable meanes to live, as they had litle cauſe to envie the religious herein. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides who knoweth not the authoritie, and Iuriſdiction of ſecular Priſtes, to hane bene farre greater, then that of any religions or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: yea to haue extended it ſelf, over the Religious them ſelues. And as for the laſt point, the Prieſtes are ſo farre (eſpecially in this age) from envying the lives and maners of the Societie in ſpeciall, that I am aſſured, and all men will confeſſe, more ſecular Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes to haue entred, and daily doe enter, into the Societie alone, then into all the other orders of Religion, putt them all together. If you knowe any other cauſe why the Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes should envie them, let me vnderſtand it, for my learning in your larger Appologie, for ſure Iam that in this Apologie you haue not as yet prooved, that the ſecular Prieſtes haue emulated the Religious, either in any of the foreſaid 3. pointtes, or in any other point els what ſo euer. <hi>Novv to your examples.</hi>
                  </p>

Doth this proove the emulation of the ſecular Prieſts in generall againſt the Religious in generall? and yet very likly it is, that the kniges vncle duke of Lancaſter had both Abbots, Priors, Monkes and friers, that tooke his parte, as well Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops as ſecular Prieſtes, and ſo was it emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religious and ſecular Prieſtes againſt Religious and ſecular Prieſtes, which proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not your intention.

If againſt the Clergie, then this emulation, was of the laytie againſt the whole Clergie, ſecular and regular. How can it ſtand, that in Wichffes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17035:78"/>time emulation was whott againſt the whole clergie, and that ſome of the clergie emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the reſt of the clergie? theſe two cannot well ſtand together.</p>
                  <p>In the next example you bring in 3. kings, like Mummers, for they ſay nothing: neither doe you there prove any thinge but in the margent, you note <hi>a malitious ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</hi> of whom, I pray you? you name no man, and yet would you haue your reader to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, of the ſecular Prieſtes, againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious: and that the ſecular Prieſtes did ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt theſe kinges to take away the Abbay landes. for if you meane not ſo? then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is to no purpoſe to prove the hurte that hath come by emulation, of ſecular Prieſtes, againſt Religious.

                  <p>The 4. example vvhich you bring, to proue the fore ſaid emulation, is of Q. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries time vvhich ſeameth very ſtrange to me.

In your next edition, or in your larger Appologie, vvhich you promis, putt out hardly, or els correct, this bragge of Religious men teaching, from beyond the ſeas, the perfecte doctrine, of not going to Hereticall churches, bicauſe they came too late, to haue that glorye, vvhich is only due to Secular Prieſtes: albeit you vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prieſtes, do ſeeme both vvrongfully and vniuſtly, to give it to others. ſuch honor bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re you to Religious, that you vvill for their ſakes, dishonor both your ſelues and your brethren.</p>

Being thus expelled the next day being Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wenſday, they diſperſed them ſelues in diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Churches, requeſting the preachers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend their caſe and pouertie, to gett them ſome money, for they had determyned to returne alltogether in Proceſſion (as it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re) and with a croſſe before them to Rhemes or Ingland. In the meane while his Holl. was informed of all by Father Parſons, and Fa. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo, who gathering ſuch of the ſchollers together as he could meet withall, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to the Pope, there was old wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and crying on both ſides. The good old ffa. Weept, as one loath to looſe ſo many ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and to Wardly children, and they on thother ſide cried for ſorrovve, that they should be conſtraind againſt their vvilles to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17035:85"/>leaue and forſake ſo louing a father. But after they had vviped their eies, the Pope ſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvith one of his chamber in their compaine, to comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Rector to receaue them agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: and at their returne, they tooke 2. others into the college vvith them, vvho aftervvard proued naughtie fellovvs called Novvell and Moonday. Not long after, they had their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier: for the gouernement of the college vvas giuen to the Fathers, to the ſchollers great contentement and good of our countrey, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo ended this firſt ſturre and diſſention.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, happened the next yere 1579. vvhich vvas rather a certaine murmure then diſſention: the vvhich if by ffa. Parſons vviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and induſtrie it had not bin preuented, vvould in time haue grovvne to an open ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The cauſe vvas this. Our ſchollers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing obtained their deſire and falling to their ſtudies vſed very zealouſly all the godly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of mortification, in ſuch ſort, as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne or tvvoe of them became ſo contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue that they vvould needs be Ieſuits. Which vyhen their companions vnderſtood, they begane to miſlike of thoſe ſpirits, alleaging that the college vvas founded for the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vertuous and learned prieſtes to help their contrey, and not to bring vp men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Religion, and leaue the harueſt at home. Where vppon fa. Parſons procured D. Allens comming vp to Rome, vvho obtained
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17035:86"/>of the Pope, to command the Generall of the Ieſuits to ſend of his Religious into Ingland. the vvhich appeaſed all this murmur. For (quoth the Schollers) let as many novv enter into the ſocietie as vvill, for vvhen they haue beene ſufficiently brought vp therin, they shalbe ſent into Ingland. And thus each par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vvas pleaſed. The fathers, for that they might receiue of the ſchollers into their ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, vvithout grudg or miſlike: and the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers, by cauſe ſuch as entred, moſt of all (if not all) should be in time emploied for their countrey. And ſo the 2. ſchollers that firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Societie of that college vvere M. Wright a conſtant Confeſſor novv in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and Iohn Barton, vvho after fell from them and looked back to the vvorld againe, as I am credibly enformed.</p>
                  <p>The 3. vvas that, vvherein M. Doctor Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shavve and M. D. Stafferton (dead long ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce) M. Warford (novv a Ieſuit) and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had their parte. I haue heard, they vvould haue had the gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege giuen to the Dominican friers, or to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue it gouerned by English ſecular prieſtes. In th'end it fell out that good fa. Alfonfo vvas diſplaced and an other put in his place.</p>
                  <p>Not many yeres after fell out another co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie betvveene the ſchollers and father Creſvvell then Rector, D. Allen being then Card. a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a ſpectator. I knovv not vvell vvhat
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17035:86"/>the cauſe vvas. but this I am ſuer that a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous prieſt novv a holy Martyr in heauen named M. Iohn Ingram, vvas not ouer vvell vſed. This ſturre in the ende procured father Creſvvells removing from thence to Spaine.</p>
                  <p>The laſt ſturre vvhich vvas the vvhotteſt endured longeſt and vexed moſt the fathers. It began (as you ſay) after Card. Allens death about the yere 1594. vpon this occaſion, as you aftervvard inſinuat, and the Actors co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: father Harvvood the miniſter finding 2. youthes clapping them ſelues on the bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or rather one for ſome reveng ierking his fellovve on the buttock vvith a rodd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he vvas out of his bed, had ſome ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vvorſer behavior and should (as I haue heard) ſay, he founde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at Buggerie, vvhich vvhen the reſt vnderſtood, it did gtieue them full ſore, that the fathers (and ſpecially In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishe fathers) should ſuſpect any of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vvith that abhominable ſinne, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d calling to mynde ſome of the fathers former actions tending to this ſuſpition, as cutting the priuie dores beneath shorter by half a foote, to ſee if there vvere any more then tvvoe feet at once at one priuie, and cutting dovvne a faier groue in the vineyard, bicauſe they vſed on their daies of recreation, to vvalk there by tvvo and tvvo. They fell firſt into ſuch a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the ſaid fa. Harvvood, that they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de a ſupplication to his Holl: deſiring him to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17035:87"/>ſend the ſaid fa. to the Gallies, for dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe and diſcrediting the Colledg, them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and their nation, vvith ſuch a calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous report. Vpon this they fell euery day mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and more, into miſlike vvith the fathers, and into this laſt ſedition. Whither the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers had cauſe to be offended, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, I leaue it to the iudgment of others. Thus much touching theſe troubles, vvherin if I haue miſreported any thing, I deſier to be better enformed, for I tell it, as I haue heard it of others, according as you tell your tales alſo by heareſay. My meaning herein not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to defend the ſchollers, or diſcredit their Superiors, but to tell the truth only,</p>
                  <p>If any do muſe at theſe frequent ſeditions, and vvould knovv the cauſes thereof, albeit my opinion is, but one doctors opinion: yet ſuch as it is, I vvill communicat it to you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing duly marked the cauſes my ſelf, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heard other mens iudgmente alſo ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ein, That vvhich I vvill ſay novv, I ſent once to father Creſvvell then Rector vpon an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvhich vvere to longe here to ſet dovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and nothinge to the purpoſe. After I had called to his mynde the contentions, vvhich had often before that time happened in the Colledge, and recounted the nomber of Spies, and revolters, from the faithe vvhich had been menbers of the ſame college, and that till that time, there had neuer happened
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17035:87"/>any one ſedition in the Seminaries of Douay or Rhemes, nor any knovven or notorious ſpie, gone ont of them, one Banes (a reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted prieſt, vvhich yet vvas apprehended and impriſoned) only excepted: I told him that I thought the cauſes of thoſe ſeditions in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, vveare one of theiſe that follovve. Either the ayre did infect them, or els our contrey men vvere of a levvde and ſeditions nature, or other vviſe that the gouernment of that college, vvas not convenient for our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish natures. If the firſt should be the cauſe, then there vvas no other remedie, but to tranſport the college into a better ayer. For the ſecond, I could not ſo hardly iudg of my contrey men, eſpecially hauing ſeene them allvvaies in Rhemes, to be both vertuous a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d obedient youthes: and to the third, I neithet vvould nor durſt attribute it to the fathers. F. Generall and Prouinciall, the Rectors, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors being ſo neare, and hauing ſo vigila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t an eye on the gouernment. What shall vve the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe novv quoth I? Mary, father, chaunge the gouerment for a time, to ſee if they vvill doe better, and liue more quietely. And if they doe not, then the vvorld muſt neads attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te it, to our evvill and ſeditious natures. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till then vve muſt ſuſpend our iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. this vvas the effect of my letter. for the vvhich he courteouſly thancked me, and ſaid he vvould communicat my reaſons vvith his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors.</p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:17035:88"/>
                  <p> But ſeeing I am on this point, I will boldly ſett downe what I haue all waies thought in that gouerment, to be not conuenient to out English nature, but is rather the cauſe both of rancor and diuiſion amongſt the ſchollers, and of the diſlike and diſcontentment of the gouernment and Gouerners.</p>
                  <p>I was penſioner in D. Allens companie in in that Colleage 4. monethes and more, and then I marked and vnderſtood the miſlike of this gouernment, by thoſe that had bene moſt deſirous of the fathers gouernment, I meane M. Sherwin, M. Array, M. Haddock M. Riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hton, and others my familiares then in the colleage. The firſt is, their open penances done in the hall, and their <hi>dicitur culpa.</hi> which is as farre from all good orderly diſcipline, that when a man doth it at the firſt, he is ſo farre ordinarily from amendment, that in his hart he doth grutch, and repine at his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, for the geuing of it. But when he is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed 3. or 4. times to doe it, then he maketh a very ſcoff and mocking or may game of it: ſo farre it is from a true pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, at is engendreth (as I ſaid) both hatred and mockery. If you ſay it is not the ſuperiors fault. I ſay it is, if he knoweth it will bring forth no other effects and yet will vſe it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is their Spies, which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors haue allwaies in ſtore, which by an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17035:88"/>name are called Angeli cuſtodes.</p>
                  <p>Theiſe ſpies at recreation time, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, ſpeake liberally againſt their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, of their gouernment and vſage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, of their apparell, meate and drinck, and againſt the ſtraight keaping of them in, and againſt what ſoeuer they thinke is not wel done in the colleadge. And all this to ſounde their compaignons. Now if one or twoe hap to diſcourſe, as he doth againſt the Superior: theeſe ſpies carry the wholy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſtraight to the Rector. After a fewe daies the other are called <hi>Coram nobis,</hi> a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther punished or rigorouſly reprehended for the ſame. Theeſe good felowes afterward recall to mynde, before whom, and in whoſe preſence and what companie, they ſpake ſuch thinges, and hauing diſcouered this good fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, they from that day forewards, hate him as a ſpie and traitor. If this be a charitable way of gouerment iudge you, and whither this be true, and practized continually or no, I referre it to the conſcience of as many of you (vnited brethrene) as haue bene brought vp in that Seminarie, and to the knowledg of all others, that haue bene brought op the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin, yea to thoſe them ſelues that haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne theſe good Angells. Nothing ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to an englishmans nature, as to be betra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed by him whom he truſteth. If ſuch ſpies were in Oxford (whoſe colleges haue as good
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17035:89"/>ſtatute and ordonances for bringing vp of youthes, if they were put in practise (no diſpleaſure to the Fathers) as they haue or can deuiſe) if ſuch ſpies I ſay weare in our colleages of Oxford, they would be pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in peeces.</p>
                  <p>The 3. cauſe of diſcontentment, mother of ſedition, is when ſuch ſchollers as haue whollie addicted them ſelues to prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to ſerue their countrey, ſee others which entend to be of the ſocietie, to be more fauored, more cherished and more often in Fa. Miniſters chamber at collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, haue more free acceſſe to the Rector, and to be better countenanced then they: this affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the Fathers beare to ſuch, can neither be wiſely hidd of th'one, nor well digeſted of th'other.</p>
                  <p>The 4. and which aggrauated the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in Fathers Creſwels time, and was the occaſion of theiſe laſt and greteſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as you ſeeme to confeſſe afterwards, is: that the Rectors and Miniſters are ouer much ſuſpicious of our English youthes thinking them to be giuen to that ſinne, which is not to be named. thereof came the cutting downe of a faire groue which was in their vineyard wherein they vſed ſomtimes to walk for their recreation, two and twoe or more together. Which doings did wonderfully animate the ſchollers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17035:89"/>their ſuperiors, as I vnderſtood by a vertuous prieſt, vvho ſince by Martyrdome is no doubt a bleſſed Sainct in Heauen.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe, grounde and beginning alſo of theiſe laſt troubles came they not of that vvhich Father Harvvood ſaid (albeit after, he ſvvore the contrary:) that the found tvvo, of thoſe libertine ladds committing that abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſinne? the man you note in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and your fellovve prieſtes now in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland ſay ſo, and you your ſelues vnderſtand ſo much by your <hi>Somme thinges much amiſſe.</hi> If it be true that Father Harvvood affirmed ſo much as in the 43. leafe you inſinuate: their diſſolucion in corners to hane bene ſo ſecret a ſinne, that he could neuer be brought to vtter it for the ſauing their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and the nations, till (forsooth) he was commanded by obedience a litle before his deathe. that he might dy, belike, vvith that glory, to haue infamed the ſtudents. Had not thoſe Northen and ſouthren laddes good cauſe, thinck you to defend their honors and the honor of their countrey? Had they not iuſt cauſe to require the Pope (as they did by ſupplication) to ſend Fa. Harvv. to the Gallies, for defamyng both the colleage and nation? Whither it vveare true or falſe god knovveth, neither vvill nor can I decide it: yet vvas this Father much more to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, then a nother Father, vvho in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:17035:90"/>of the factious ſchollers, vvithout reſpect of their honor or of the honor of our nation, or of his ovvne conſcience, letted not to ſend about the vvorld gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall articles againſt all the ſchollers and prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes of that faction, the vvhich contained more greuous and abhominable<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinnes then Father Harvvood diſcouered. Of this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion then begane all that fovvle ſturre vvhich as the diſconted bretherne ſay, had like to haue vndoone and ruynated that Colledge.</p>
                  <p>The 5. is, that the Rectors (yea our English Rectors) in the Romaine Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge haue no reſpect of ſuch Graduates as are made in our Vniuerſities in Ingland, but vvill make more of a boy, and giue him better countenance, and place him hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher at the table, then to a Baccheler or a M. of arte, vvhich cannot be but a great cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue to ſuch graduats a great fault a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t eſpecially of English Fa. vvho either doe or should knovve, vvhat eſteeme leatning a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d degrees take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſcholes (albe it many in deed are vnvvorthie of them) are in Ingland: and hovv an vnlearned man hauing a degree, is of greater reſpect and credite then a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re learned then he hauing no degree. This is the good cuſtome of our conntrey that carrieth ſuch reſpect and honor to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, albeit the Graduat be not vvorthie
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17035:90"/>therof, bicauſe all men preſume he hath the learning requiſite to the degree. But the Fathers, whither it be vnder the couler of making them humble, or for ſomme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe beſt knowen to them ſelues, doe giue very litle, or no credit or countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce at all to Graduates. And a nother thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge) which hath bene noted of ſomme men) they neuer ſent any from that col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege into Ingland with any degree of ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les on their backs 2. only excepted,
<note place="margin">D. Barrett. D. Stillinghton.</note> who being ſpecially fauored and loued of Father Alfonſo were made Doctors in Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their miſſion, yet neither of them went into Ingland, but were both ſtaied at Rhemes.</p>
                  <p>You goe abont afterwards to defend the Fathers from this calumniation (as you tearme it) how I pray you?
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fol.</hi> 92.93.</note> Mary they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue receued many Graduates into the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. What is this to the complaint of not reſpecting Graduats in the Seminarie? yes (ſay you) for many Graduates haue liued in the Seminarie with them much eſteamed and honored by the Ieſuits. You name 4. and yet 3. of them vpon my knowledg, we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re fauored as the firſt Authors and bringers in of the Fathers to that gouernment, and honored not for their degrees, but as Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, and as Prieſtes they ſate at a higher
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17035:91"/>and more honorable table then the reſt. But if rheiſe 4. haue beene reſpected, how many others haue bene neglected? You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe in the ſame place, that they are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made of by the Fathers, if their vettue anſwere to their degree. Who ſeeth not, that you confeſſe, they are not reſpected for their degree, but for their vertue only? Put caſe he be not ſo vertuous as his ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or would haue him, shall he therby looſe the reſpect that is due to his degree? There are punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes for his faulte, his degree ſtill reſpected. But with the Fathers who you ſay, are men of order, in this caſe of degrees, is keapt litle order.</p>
                  <p>To the man you note in the mergent (who complayned of the diſgrace of degrees) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ſent from Rhemes to Rome, I ſaid thus to him. Maſter Bagshawe your are going to Rome and in your companie ſuch and ſuch (namyng 2. poore ſchollers that ſerued him and the reſt at the table) when you come theare, you shall ſee theis boies (your ſeruants here) aſwell clothed, lodged and ſerved there as your ſelf, paraduenture more in fauor, and better liked of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior then you, and to ſitt higher at the table them you, can you abide this? thinck on it, for ſo it will happen, as it did in deed. Which made him, Maeſter Stafferton, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fotd (now a Ieſuite) Fixer, D. Cicill and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17035:91"/>hauing bene all Graduats of a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt in Oxford to diſlike and ſtorme at it, as many others haue doone ſince, and ſtill wil doe, till Graduate, be better reſpected. If one poore Doct. iudgment might be heard and allowed, I thinck veryly, if thoſe fore ſaid impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes weare taken awaie, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and our yonthes would liue louingly, &amp; in peace together. But if this be not remedied then I ſay (though I be no Prophet, yet beare I a Prophets name) that theſe diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may well for a time lye ſmothering in their breaſts: but one day, doe the Fathers what they can, they will flush out into flames of diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as th'others haue done before. It is naturall to that college the foreſaid impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimente not remoued, but remayninge in their force.</p>
                  <p>And to augment mens ſuſpicious and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the ſmall accompt the Fathers make of degrees and Graduats, they haue obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a ſtrang and exttaordinary Bull to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcredirt and dishonor of our whole nation, to ſtopp all English ſtudents in their banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the degree of Doctorshipp either in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie or lawe, I wonder they putt not in Phiſicke alſo, (Doctor Norden, a Doctor of Phiſick being ſo great an enemy to them as you the vnited bretherne do shewe in this your Apologie) and by conſequence to ſtopp them from all perferment and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17035:92"/>in ſtraung countreis in this time of their banishments. I may well call it ſtrang, bicauſe all ſtrangers do wonder ſtrangly at it. And I may well terme it extraordinarie, for that ſince Sainct Peter ſate in the Sea of Rome, and that Vniuerſities haue bine erected, theare was neuer ſuch a Bull ſent out into the worlde. The Sea of Rome hath ever bene ſo fauorable to learning &amp; degrees, that it hath inſtituted and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med many Vniuerſities, hath geuen aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to certaine, to giue degrees and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke Doctors. Yea Canons that are bownd to reſidence, <hi>Quia datur beneficium pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter officium,</hi> And to ſerue in the Church Yet in fauor of learning may be ſent to the Vniuerſities to ſtudie, and theare to receaue their fruits till they haue taken their degree. But alas? our poore English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are not ſufficientlye afflicted with ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment from our countreye and parents, but more affliction muſt be putt vpon their shoulders, and as it weare ſegregated from all other nations, and bounde to be men vnworthie and vncapable of Doctorshipp and that by the higheſt iudge, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal on earth. And why? for ſooth bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our yong Doctors muſt not ſitt above (I will not ſay Ieſuits, but) other grauer and elder Prieſts. For this cauſe the Pope hath annulled and abbreged the Ptiuilegs
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17035:92"/>of all Vniuerſities in reſpect of vs poore Soules. This is a point of Mortification in deed, but lett vs here the Bull, which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſaith thus. <q>Our will and pleaſure is, that none of th'english nation hear after ſo long as Hereticks prevaile in Ingland, &amp;c. doe take degree of Doctor in Diuinitie or in one of the lawes, vnleſſe they haue ſtudied 4. ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in the ſame ſcience or profeſſion. Thoſe ended, to ſtudie 4. yeres more to make him prompt and ſolide, and to become more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture graue and learned: Nor then neither shall he proceade, without the conſent and approbation of the Superior of the College or Seminary wherin he hath ſtudied or bene brought vpp, nor without the approbation of the Protector of the Nation or his vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent in thoſe partes where thoſe English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would be promoted, &amp;c. Who ſoeuer then shall take the degree of Doctor in any place or contrey with in the time and yeres above preſcribed, or without the leaue of his Superior, Protector or his vicegereut, we pronownce the degree to be none, nor ſuch a one to be called a Doctor. And beſids this he shall encurre the ſentence of excomunic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the abſolution there from we ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reſerve to our ſelves and to the Sea A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick, &amp;c. And we will this to be in force, not with ſtanding any Apoſtolick decree what ſoeuer, or any ſtatute, cuſtome or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledgs
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17035:93"/>of Vniuerſities given them by the Apoſtolick Bulls, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this Bull is, leaſt youg men be made Doctors and by that meanes the degree come into contempt in Ingland viz: So great care had theſe informers of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reſpect of degrees in our contrey: for in all other nations in the world, young men may be made Doctors this reaſon not withſtanding. An other reaſon is, leaſt by this doctorshipp, they should goe or ſitt before auncient Prieſtes and learneder, then they are. And this laſt reaſon ſeameth to be the chiefeſt motiue why, this Bull vvas procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and yet not with ſtanding this Bull, a younge man may march a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſitt before an el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and grauer Prieſt. For example. If a young man be a Bacheler or Licentiat either in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie or lawe (which is nothing els with vs, but an Inceptor Doctor) would not an el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and grauer Prieſt thinck you, give him place in reſpect of his degree? Noe doubt he would. Then what haue you gotten by your Bull? You muſt gett out an other, if you will ſtopp them from Bachelorshipp or Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatship, or els thoſe that tak ſuch degrees will ſitt above you, be you Ieſuit or vnited Prieſte not graduated. Be of good cheare all you that haue not ſtudied in the Seminaries, for this Bull toucheth you not. Next note that it ſaieth in altero Iuris, that is, in one of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17035:93"/>the lawes, as if it vvould ſay. No man can proceed Doctor in the Civill lawe alone, or in the Canon lawe alone, without the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid conditions. But vpon my words you may procead in both lawes without incurring the penalties of the Bull, becauſe it is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Conſtitution and therfore to be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his caſe, which is in altero Iure in one of the lawes, and not to be extended ad Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoratum in vtroque Iure to Doctorshipp in both lawes, for the rule is. <hi>Odia reſtringi &amp; fauores conuenit ampliari.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſids, if I should ſay the bull to be of no force bicauſe it may eaſly be proved to be Surreptice, as alſo it vvas not promulgated publickly, and in the place, and with the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie, that all like penall Conſtitutions are accuſtomed to be, you would haue much adoe to prove the contrarie.</p>
                  <p>This Bull was obtained immediatly after the peace made with the ſchollers in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine College viz. the 19. of Sept. 1597. but yet was it not printed till 3. yeres after (when it pleaſed ſuch as had obteined it) viz in the yere 1601. The cauſe as I ſuſpect was for feare leaſt others vvould followe the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of D. Bagshaw D. Stafferton (dead long ſinces) Do: Weſton (vvho hath bene a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Diuinitie many yeres in our Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Rhemes and Doway) and D. Norris (Whom in contempt you call Italian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors)
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17035:94"/>vvho going from the College tooke their degrees by the waye.</p>
                  <p>See yet the great diuerſitie of Iudgment betvvene D. Allene the Father of our Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, and the Procurers of this Bull. When D. Bagshavve and D. Stafferton came to Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and had ſignified to him they were Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, he was ſo farre from contemninge them, that the next day at dinner he brought them into the hall and placed them him ſelf in their due places, next to th'other Doctors in Diuinitie, th'one above M. Licentiat Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon and th'other above me, being but Doctor of Lawe. And this place they keapt ſo longe as they remained there, to all mens liking and contentment. If ſuch a Bull had either bene neceſſary profitable or honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our contrey, wold not do: Allene (who had as great care of our cuntrey as theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers haue) haue pro cured it? Yes I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you. But god be bleſſed that ſome of vs vveare Doctors before theſe men cam to governe the court and cuntrey, els might we haue gone begg our bread, and many a one blovv their nailes beſids. But vvill you ſee the abſurditie of it? In moſt vniuerſities (as in this alſo of <hi>Pont a Mouſson</hi>) theare are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine benefices affected to the vniuerſitie, and due (when they fall) to the Senior Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. Put the caſe an Englishman hath ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died his time and is made Licentiat in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17035:94"/>(as thoſe are here before they be Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors) with one or twoe more with him who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Senior he is. when the time cometh to proceade Doctor his fellowes paſſe, and he is ſtaied by the vertue of this Bull. Some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes after falleth out a benefice, which one of his fellowes catcheth, and he by reaſon of this bull loſeth it. See what good then it bringeth to our Nation. Againe one that hath ſtudied the lawes ſome yeres is Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiat, and may when he will take his Doctors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hipp. he is in a vniuerſitie where a Doctors place falleth vacant a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he is otherwiſe found capable for it, but by reaſon he prooceded not Doctor (it being a Doctors place) he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it. And ſo by this buggy Bull, all hope of promocion and preferment is taken away hereafter from vs poore Englishmen. <hi>Honos alit artes.</hi> Who will now ſtudie with any cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage either in Diuitie to conuince heretiks, either in the Canon lawe to gouerne the church, when they are barred of the reward of their ſtudies and defrauded of the fruites of their labors? But you vvill (perhapps) ſay to me here, as you do often in your Apologie to your diſcontented bretherne, that I find fault with his Holl: actions and doinges. for anſwere wherto, I ſay: I do ſo in deed and vveare I in Rome and worthie to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his preſence, I would appeale in this point from his Holl: ill informed, to his Hol:

                  <p>The 4. fault I find with you, is, that you ſay: That the Cardinall Caietan and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the Ieſuits did hinder the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of D. Lewes B. of Caſſano, butfalsly as you haue credibly heard, Nay, that vvhich you heard to the contrary was credibly falſe. For, vvhich of you haue not heard that the ſaid B. and fa: Parſons ſtood for the redd cap, and that the report we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that one of the two should vveare it? ſo that euery man as he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the partie vvished and deſired it. yea, the report runneth abrode that many hands and ſubſcriptions vveare gathered in Ingland and Flannders in Fa: Parſons favor for the redd hat. The ſuſpition that the 2. before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med labored for him againſt the B. vvas en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by this, that the yce beiug now bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Cardinall shipp by the creation of Tolledo one of the Societie, and Tolledo beiug dead, that the generall of the Ieſuits and the Protector, (who was vvholly the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits) vveare more vvilling to haue a man of their ovvne and wholly addicted to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie to be preferred, rather then a man, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for many yeres they accompted of as one not at all addicted to the ſocietie, but ioyned to the faction that vvas againſt them, as you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate before, and in this place alſo. Beſids, as theare vvas no man of our vvholle nation thought ſo hable for that dignitie as fa: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17035:96"/>ſo no man vvas ſo fitt to be oppoſed to the B: as he, for by all licklyhood vvithout any oppoſition, the B. might haue carried it avvay. An other preſumption of fa perſons preferment vvas, that having (as the reporte runneth) made a booke of the ſucceſſion of Ingland in favor of the Infante of Spaigne, he had gotten therby both favour and credite vvith the good old kinge, vvho could doe much in the obteyning of a Cardinalls hate. And beſids all this at that preſent time, vvhen theſe rumors rane abrode, fa. Parſons came from Spaigne to Rome, in the companie of tvvo Spanish Cardinalls. All theis pteſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions put together made ſome proofe he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired to the redd hate, and that the Protector and Generall vvould ſtand for him againſt the Biſshop. Yet to giue you more certaine ſatisfaction that Fa: perſons and his frends did all they could to hinder the B. (for vvhat cauſe god knovveth) I vvill (to imitate you) ſett dovvne the Bishopps ovvne vvords in his laſt lettere that euer he vvrott to me, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the 10. of march 1595. after ſome fevve perticuler affaires thus he ſaithe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>We haue loſt our good Card: Allene, he made me executor of his vvil vvith 3. Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, and vve euer haue bene frends though ſome euill diſpoſed did ſeeke to ſeperat vs for their ovvne gaine, and ill purpoſes. And novv there is ſuch a ſtinck iug ſturre in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17035:97"/>Spaigne and Rome, to make Fa Parſons Cardinall and ſo by conſequente to exclude me, that it is allmoſt incredible. But yet it is ſo thoughe it be lick to haue no other effect, but the diſcovering of Ambition, the blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that bleſſed Religion and diſcord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our nation and perſecution againſt me, leaſt I ſtep before and ſtand betvvene them and the fire. The doers of this are but 2. or 3. of our Nation, vvhich tumble all vp and dovvne. All the reſt, beſt and vviſſeſt do loue and honor me. And in this Court it is merveiled at of ſtrangers highe and lovve. They ſay I am an Italian, that I paſſe not for the Nation, that I am Brittannus and not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Anglus. That I vvil neucr returne into Ingland, if it vveare Catholick: falſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent lies and ſclanders, vvhich I pray you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute as occaſion shal ſerve. By lies, they may hinder others, but neuer are like to helpe them ſelues. In deed I am 61. yeres old, and am not therfore like to ſee Ingland, but if the way were open, I vvould leave Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick and all vvorldly ſtates in this caſe, and go to ſerve my naturall conntrey and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey men, vvhom in banishment I haue euer ſerued and loued more then all theis good fellovves. I ſeeke not to be Cardinall, bicauſe I knovve not, <hi>An ille ſtatus expediat &amp; ſaluti animae meae conveniat.</hi>
                     </q> But let god do his devine prouidence, vvho knovveth vvhat is beaſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17035:97"/>for vs all. Thus I confidently tell you my mynde, bicauſe I knovv you love me and I will ever loue you. Thus much the Bishoppe.</p>
                  <p>Novv of theeſe premiſſes, coniecture I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you vvhither the ſchollers vvho deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the preferment of him, vvhom they too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke to be founder as it vveare of that Collea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, and the fitteſt and vvorthieſt of all ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prieſts of our nation to haue that honor after Card: Allens death, had not iuſt cauſe to ſuſpect the forenamed to be his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and hindrers from attayning that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe dignitie? For my parte, as I vvas no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aler either for the one nor th'other, ſo I vviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed one of the tvvoe to be advaunced, I ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not vvhich. For knovving that thoſe tvvoe that ſtoode for it, to be fitteſt and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pableſt men of our vvhole nation, both at home or abroad, I ſtood indifferent, both in reſpect of our contreis good, and of my ovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne particular, both being able men to ſerve our countrey and my eſpeciall frends. Mary, yet to tell you the truth, I beleved as much then that Fa. Parſons should or vvould be Card. as I beleave novv the report of travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers vvho advouch that M. Geffrey Poole or M. Tho. Fitsherbert shalbe Card. And although it might be true that Fa. Par. Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the B. all he coold, (for ſome iuſt cauſes beſt knovvne to thim ſelf) yet of this I am aſſured, that Fa. Par: had no vvill nor inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17035:98"/>to procure it for him ſelf. For I ſavve a lettre vvritten from Rome by a dere and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret frend of his, that Fa. Par. vvith much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe and traveill, and at the great ſuite of his Generall had miſſed or refuſed the redd ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, vvishing that ſome fit man of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had it. vvhich is an invincible argument to prove, that if Fa. Par. had had the vvill and intention to be Card. he should not haue had neade to employ all his frends to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the Pope to the Contrarye.</p>

Howſoeuer it be diuulged vnder the name of vnited Prieſts, it is nothing els, but a certayn narration of English matters, tolde ouer and ouer, by one Parſons a Ieſuite, in Rome, to the English ſtudents there, and by ſome of them rightly tearmed his mother Hubberds tale, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning not any one thing of worth, but a fardel of Idle and boyish ſurmiſes, vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,

                  <p>That he should vſe other mens names to this <hi>Apologie,</hi> (vvhich hath been a former practiſe of his, and that ſomtymes pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, as in ſetting out his titles vnder the name of Dolema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,) me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of modeſty do not ſo mutch vvonder, as that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf religious, being publikly charged vvith eyght imprinted libells, of moſte euill and ſcandalous ſucceſſe, already, should perſiſt in the ſame infamous manner of vvriting. My ſilence almoſt twenty yeares now, may teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy my vnvvillingnes to handle ſutch matters, more then for the neceſſary defence of my Good name: which, beſides the former En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish libell, I ſee impugned in an other ſett out in Latin, to the view of the whole world, ſomething reſembling the English, but ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and peruerted, as by the conference of the one and the other, a man may ſe the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of bothe. Three or fovver generall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, vvhich the libeller vſeth, I leaue to other men &amp; better opportunity to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvear: as his pretended zeale for ſuperiors, his magnificall talk againſt paſſion, his cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf vnder the whole Society of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and his vaunting of a body of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks (as he tearmeth them) vnited vnto him.</p>
                  <p>His talk againſt diſobedience and paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it onely beateth the ayre, and is obiected but of colour and courſe, ſo to be imputed to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17035:206"/>others, by a moſt exorbitant and diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man, doth shevv as much exceſſe of a prowde and hipocriticall humor, as defect of a good conſcience to reflect duty vppon himſelf. Of the Society of the Ieſuits, (the liking vvhereof becauſe it is an order allowed in the Churche hath been and is profeſſed by vs, &amp;c.) I doubt not but there are many, vvhich know not, and many, vvhich vtterly diſlike of the practiſes of the libeller and his complices: and therefore he doth them no ſmall iniury and diſgrace, vvhich maketh the credit of his order a mask for his owne diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: ſince thoſe be <hi>caſtra rebellium, vbi eſſe eſt mereri.</hi> What a goodly body of Catholiks the libeller hath had to ioyn with him (by brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vvhereof he endaungereth all whome he inuolueth.) For his ſeditious practiſes from tyme to tyme, for the procuring of M. Blak vvells authority, for the ſtirres in Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for the oppreſſion of the Romaine Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, for the defaming of the ſecular Cleargy of England with ſchyſme, and other ſtrat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemes, vvhen iudicious men conſider, they vvill ſee (according to our prouerb,) great boaſt and ſmall roaſt, and the ranking of him ſelf vvith Cardinalls and principall men of our nation, doth shew the mans humors, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, and meditations: whereas in the end he vvill marre the play, for that he ſeeth not hovv euill his acts become the ſtage.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:17035:207"/>
                  <p> The firſt particular thing agaynſt me vvhich he obiecteth, is cloſe dealing vvith the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, in his marginall note of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish but not of the Latin Epiſtle to his Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines. And it is the laſt thing fol. 207. wherehe ſayth. As ſoone as they vnderſtood their tvvoe meſſengers were reſtrayned at Rome, and not like to preuayle, then Doctor Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw vvas ſent for from Wisbich to London to treat vvith the Councell. And what follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vved? Forſoothe the remoue of twoe or three Ieſuits to the Tower with dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. A greate matter I warrant yow. And how doth all this appear? by a letter of N.N. 15. of Apr. 1599. vvho may not be named for fear. The letter is cyted fol. 150. conteyning fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer coniecturall ſurmiſes, all foolish, and the twoe firſt grounded vpon playne vntruthes.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt. The day (ſayth he) after D. Bagshavv vvas gone, the Miniſter of the tovvne comming into the Caſtle, ſayd, that D. Bagshavv tolde him, that he looked to be remooued ere it vvere long: &amp; therefore it is thought he vvas cauſe of his ovvne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue. Firſt, I vvill not except againſt the teſtimony of a Miniſter whome this letter-maker vvould make to vtter a ſecret, if not an vntruthe, becauſe I know him, and diners others of that towne, to be of ſuch moral ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and ſincerity as in that reſpect they vvould haue nothing to do vvith the Ieſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17035:207"/>faction, as hauing often by others and themſelues experienced their perverting &amp; deprauing mens ſpeeches. Then if I had told him I expected my Remooue, (as I neuer did for I did not once think of it) he &amp; the whole tovvne knew, that I might haue doubted my Remooue, becauſe it vvas threatned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one of the Iuſtices, fourteen dayes before, falling out with me vpon matter of diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Religion. Agayn, I had Receaued a letter, (which is well knowne, &amp; vvas a great meanes to declare myne innocency to the LL. of the Councel,) that I should look to my ſelf, for that there was a plott layd to ouer throvv me, by the English Spaniolized prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſers. So that the firſt is but a falſe grovvnd, and a malitious inference. And ſo is the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that I should ſend M. Bluet vvord, my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for vvas, concerning certayn matters, vvhich vve had talked of, &amp;c. For clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I being debarred to vvrite at all, or ſpeak but in the hearing of the Purſuiuant, ſent M. Blu. word, that he should not greeue himſelf, with deuiſing, vvhat the cauſe of our trooble is: for that he could neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knovv it, vntill I, or ſome which were priuy to it, did vtter it vnto hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the third, M. Archers vvords are not worth the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of, nor his Remooue a matter vvorth three ſtravves one way or other. for the laſte, if there vvere a falſe brother in Wisbich it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17035:208"/>might be aſſoone the vvriter of this letter as any other and perhapps ſooner. Are not heer accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, proofs, and witneſſes paſſing ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Ar not theſe goodly authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticalls where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the libeller ſo much braggeth? But to omitt theſe bibble babbles.</p>
                  <p>My firſt dealing (as the libeller ſcoffingly tearmeth it) with the Councell was to defend the honor of our Religion, and euen vvith ſuffering torments, to declare mine innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy vvhich was brought into great doubt, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by one Anfield, ſeruant to F. Parſons &amp; after a Purſuiuant. My ſecond dealing with the Councell vvas, to shevv myſelf guiltles of an horrible treaſon, layd to Squire and his fellovves: vvho auerred the contriuer, moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and vrger therof to be one Walpool a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, ſubordinate (as the other English Ieſuits are, if F. Parſons ſay true,) to the ſayd Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. How farre he is to be charged vvith ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning or concurring vvith the one, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, or the other his ſubiect, I leaue to the due place of diſcuſſion. It is vvell knovvne to many, and ſome of great honor (men vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception) can teſtifye in my troble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Squire, that the Earle of Eſſex vvas ſent from the Queen, to take order for my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the Tower. And M. Wade, whome novv the Ieſuits make ſo fauorable to me &amp; others, vpon the firſt information giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, wrote to the Earle of Eſſex and M.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17035:208"/>Secretary, that there was no vvay to deale vvith me but with extremity: although af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he changed his mynde whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſguiſed probably at firſt, vvas afterwards better opened. Novv vvhat a pregnant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectural head hath this libeller, vvho writeth, that I procured myne ovvne ſending for to London, to treat vvith the Councel? And vvherfore forſooth? For that vve vnderſtood, the tvvoe meſſengers ſent to Rome vvere impriſoned, &amp;c. That year vvith the libeller vvent backvvard, as the ſunn did in Achabs Dyall, or elſe he folyshlye profeſſed the arte of lyinge, hauinge ſo vveake a memorie. My apprehenſion was in the beginning of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and theirs in Rome vvas in December after. Whereof the libeller should haue had good cauſe to haue ſome Remembrance for he knovveth that amonge a number of tales of the like qualitye and truthe he tolde the tvvoe Prieſts, that I had a pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Queen of England: vvhich was but the ordinary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovvance to cloſe priſonners, but that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his looſe tongue, to vſe ſuch inſultations and indignityes. Therefore by putting ſuch a fovvle, groſſe, and palpable vntruthe for the firſt accuſation, (the firſt in euery order of things being the meaſure of others,) a man may gheſſe of the reſt. And I vvishe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller in due fear may vvay, hovv abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God <hi>pondus &amp; pondus is,</hi> (as the vviſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17035:209"/>man ſayth) a vvayght and a vvayght. My Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue from Wisbich vvas (ſayth he) a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment to the Queens penſion: and yet the remooue of Ieſuits from Wisbich, hauing the ſame allovvance, vvas no preferment but a detriment. If the libeller had had any true zeal of the honor of God and Religion, he should haue vvished the remooue of the Ieſuited from Wisbich. Their ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there had made the greateſt ſcandall, that vvas giuen in this tyme: vvhereof no cauſe could be imputed to the vnited Prieſts, vvhich con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as before, vvithout the leaſt innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Catholiks had vvritten thither that they had rather haue ſuſteyned death of their bodyes, then ſuch an offence to ſoules. Some of them had com thither, and vpon their knees requeſted F.

Some of the temporall Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates had tolde them to their faces, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitiſme from a <hi>ſerpigo</hi> vvas becom a <hi>gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and therefore to be cutt of: and the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per had longe before my trooble ſovvght to remooue ſome for theire ſeditiousneſſe. Their Agency and conſiſtoriall common wealth was often ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled by Miniſters in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, to the great diſgrace of Catholik Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Their ſeditious and diſorderly beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17035:209"/>vvas ſuch that not onely the Iuſtices in commiſſion disliked them but euen ſome youths of the tovvne of Wisbich, ſcattered abroad, &amp; offered to iuſtify moſt diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vvritings againſt them: Grieuous accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been vttered againſt ſome of them, by three vvoemen their proſelites, vvhereof enſevved examinations, Rumors of indight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, expectation of arraygnments terrors to them ſelues, troobles to the quiet, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of all iuditious Catholiks. In vvhich caſe ſome of the Ieſuited offering vvith mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to procure their ovvne Remooue, (vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon shame or Remorſe God he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveth,) Gods iuſtice may appear, in that the book of titles made for the aduancement of the English Ieſuited, and turned in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue to their diſgrace and daunger, ſome of them being principally called into queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for thoſe titles, and the cunning plott of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning Squire and others, ſerued to bring to paſſe, that the tovver vvhich vvas intended for me and others vvas aſſigned othervviſe, and the politik canuaſers fel into the pitt, vvhich the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues had digged for others. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other cauſe of cloſe dealing vvith the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, the libeller imagineth to haue bin, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them that the ſubordination was not for Religion, but for ſtate practiſe: and by likelyhood ſome promiſe to them that it should not ſtand. For M. Blackvvels titles
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17035:210"/>vvhether they vvere begon for God, or for God shall be ended, God in his iudgement and fitt time vvill deſcrye. I knovve one much Ieſuited ſignified to the Counſell his likinge of M. Blackvvills authoritye the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe it should not be diſpleaſing to the Councell for that it tended onlye to the taking awaye of facultyes and ſo conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to the hinderinge of reconciliation, which in time might be the ouerthrowe of religion. For other dealing vvith the Councel about him, I am ashamed of the vnworthines of the libeller vvhich himſelf discouereth. What vvant of modeſty is it to blaſe ſuch falſe and foolish narration? What indiſcretion to abuſe the name of the Councel about ſuch toyes? It is well knowne if it pleaſed God ſo to moue their honorable vvisdomes, they could ridde England of all the Ieſuited vvith leſſe labour, then the libeller beſtowed in this his paltry Rapſody, and vvith leſſe adoe then was my Remooue from Wisbich to London. But vvhat fear doth a vvicked conſcience cary vvith it? Allane late Cardinall of vvorthy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory in his Apologie of the Seminaryes, fol. 71. vvriteth. We proteſt, that neither the Re. Fathers of the Society of the holy name of Ieſus, vvhome the people call Ieſuits, (an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe clauſe being in the inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of their miſſion into England, that they deale not in matters of ſtate, vvhich is to be shevved, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17035:210"/>vvith their late generalls hand of worthy memory,) neither the Prieſts either of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaryes, or others, haue any commiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, or inſinuation from his Holines, or any other their ſuperior either in Religion, or of the Colleges, to mooue ſedition, or to deal againſt the ſtate or temporall gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Fa. Parſons himſelf alſo vvriteth in his anſvvear to S. Fran. Haſtings fol. 71. in the third perſon: So then Fa. Parſons proteſteth, (as I am credibly informed,) that he vvas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer conſenting, vvitting, vvilling, inducing, yelding, or priuy to any (ſuch) perſonal atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt againſt her Maieſty in his life. Parſons In the ſupplication to the Queen made by one Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit for all the reſt and they all ſubiect to Fa. Parſons, is not shee tearmed moſe mighty, moſt mercifull, moſt feared, beſt beloued Princeſſe, the shott anchor of all their iuſt hopes, perfect in all princely duty, ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ieſty and vvhat not? Is not proteſtation made vnto her that they vvill yeeld and perſvvade in conſcience all te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall obedience, and take her parte euen againſt the Popes army? In this libell, is not Fa Parſons made a moſt free and innocent man from treaſons, neuer tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, neuer named in the arraygnment of any? And doth nor M. Blakvvell himſelf in one of his decretalls forbid bookes made againſt the ſtate? Nay goeth he not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and chargeth M. Mushe and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſortes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17035:211"/>that they be medlers in ſtate matters? Is it not a common obiection againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Cleargy that they goe about to bring the king of Scotland to the crovvne of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland being an Heretik? Doth not Fa. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſay that M. Doctor Bishop. and M. Charnock vvith their aſſociats were found to be Scotish in faction? And in this libell is not M. Watſon ſayd to be ſent by the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prieſts to the king of Scotland? And are not vve charged that vve are to deal vvith the king of Fraunce to ſubiect England vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? After ſuch proteſtation, ſuch zeale for the ſtate, ſuch charging of others, did any fear remaine in the libeller that he should not be beleeued? Would any man think that the opinion of tvvoe or three Prieſts could ſway vvith the Councel or mooue any thing, and that againſt the libeller and his body of Catholiks? No no the libeller knoweth well ynough the great vigilancy, experience, and iudiciouſnes of the Councell in ſtate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. It is well knovvne that Fa. Parſons in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d after contrary Proteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt made, and that vnder his obedience to farre and foolishly dealt in ſtate matters, that ſome principall Catholiks ſent him vvorde to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte the realme for othervviſe they would deliuer him to the temporal magiſtrate. And this is the true cauſe of his departure which the libel would ridiculouſly colour
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17035:211"/>that he might be freed from being thought to be a renegado. His cariage ſince (vvhich particulerly hath been propoſed befor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent iudges) hath been ſutable to that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull perſwaſion vvhich he vſed at Rome to the ſtudents there, that they should haue at ſtate and all: for with ſtate medling they could but dy, and dy they should if they were taken vvithout ſtate medling.</p>
                  <p>Now after all his turmoyles, browilleryes, libells, attempts, and inuaſions ended with shame and confuſion, to retayn ſtill his body of Catholicks in good opinion of him (a fevv God knoweth, whereof ſome are ſyncere with ſcrupulous ignorance, and others very facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vvith partiall preiudice) he telleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an olde ſtale tale of cloſe dealing with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel which in very truthe being tolde in plain tearmes is this, he muſt ſtrike &amp; we may not warde: he muſt accuſe, and vve may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: he muſt irritate againſt religion, and we may not pacifie: he muſt falſely pretend and by pretending diſgrace the Catholick fayth, and we may not ſyncerely cleer it: he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as much as in him lyeth our prince to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, our country to inuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, our friends and our ſelues to ſlaughter, our profeſſion to contempt and malediction, and vve may not refuſe to receaue his wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds in our whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But ſince his ouerweening of him ſelf is ſo great, let him aſſure him ſelf that vvhat lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yaltly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17035:212"/>he deceiptfully proteſteth, vve vvill dutifully performe againſt all trayterous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctizers vvhatſoeuer. It is ſo far from vs to be afrayd of dealing vvith the Councell wherein we haue and vvill alwayes vſe ſyncerity that vve think he had little vvitt vvhich did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect it, himſelf being charged to haue dealt moſt dishoneſtly vnderhand in that kinde a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d we vvould count it the greateſt earthly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit vvhich could happen to vs, if the LL. of the moſt honorable Councell vvould deal with vs for the building vp of that which this libeller hath to his power ruined.</p>
                  <p>And in this point, not onely our better warrant, but the infinit leuity of the libeller may appear, who alwayes maketh Cardinall Allen his copeſmate, and in his table of men abuſed by vs hath put him in the ranck. Now let any indifferent ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſence iudge whether he be abuſed by thoſe which ſeek to credit his proteſtation before mentioned, to follovv his direction, and to imitate his quiet &amp; Apoſtolicall courſe, or by thoſe that by their ſeditious shufflings haue made his proteſtation to be thought perfidious, and by thinking them ſelues ſomebody, vpon emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue runne another clea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary courſe to that vvhich he did. And for further marke of the ſame ridiculous vanity in his Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, the moſte reuerend Bishop of Trica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica novv Nuncius in the Lovv countryes is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17035:212"/>put in as diſobeyed by vs and refuſed to be iudge of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſyes. This is not only a notorious ly, but the clean contrary is true. He hauing his inſtructions and commiſſion for England from the Pope himſelf, in his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the ſecular clergy vvilleth them ſo to comport them ſelues as they doe not irritate the temporall ſtate. Doe vve or the Ieſuits diſobey in this point? And the lyke might be ſayd of euery other point if opportunity ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and pacience in men to hear ſuch illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; audacious boldenes in vttering vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes as this libeller vſeth. One point further I vvould not omitt. The ſame Bishop tolde me and others and vvilled vs to intimate it to our countrymen, that in the Spanish inuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the year 1588. vvhen all English aſvvell Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks as others vvere deſigned to slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Pope had no intereſt, no he vvas not ſo much as priuvco the particuler circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that deſigne. If any man compare this spoken of his credit vvith the booke publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed that year in the name (vſurped as may be thought) of the Cardinall and other ſembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pamphlets ſince vvherein the libeller hath been a ſpeciall ſtickler he shall ſee in a principall point of our difference, who be the abuſers of the Pope and his Nuncius, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Allen, and others?</p>
                  <p>That is pleaſeth therefore this goodly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller to tearme our actions treacherous, he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17035:213"/>shevveth vvhat be his ovvne, by vvhich he vvould meaſure other mens. And vvhereas he likeneth M. Bluet and others to Alcimus and Simon in the bookes of the Machabees, vve hope in God the iuſt iudge of all men, that in tyme vve shall haue ſatisfaction, and in the mean vvhile vve make not our ſelues better then the vvhole army of the liuing God, which by his permiſſion vvas exprobrated by an vncircumcized and baſtardly Philiſtim.</p>
                  <p>An appendix of ſtate matters is the incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the lavv of premunire vvherein vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, vnprofitably, and moſt daungerou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly the libellers faction inuolued them ſelues and their abettors, and are diſcontented that we auoyded it our ſelues &amp; vvarned others. And in this point the libeller pleaſeth himſelf in retorting a dilemm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And it is admirable, that any men should ſo farre be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer to their ovvne ſence, as for pride vvithout any shadovv af the leaſt good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heauen, they should infolde them ſelues and their friends in ſuch dangerous ſtatutes, and there is no doubt but vvyſe men vvill looke to the cauſer of theſe inconueniences.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17035:213"/>The aſſociation as it vvas wholly to haue bin referred to the good liking of his Holineſſe, and vvas grounded vppon ſuch ſyncere indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency as the Ieſuits aboue hand were fayn to comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, ſo it should haue bin vvithout any cauſe of exaſperating or diſlike of the temporall ſtate, and ſo the often repeated ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyricall a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d falſe ſurmiſes againſt it, are grown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vppon emulation and paſſion, vvithout reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And it vvas well prouided in the rules of the aſſociation, that vve in priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should haue no authority: that it might be ſeen vve ſought the common good and not of our ſelues. And vvhereas he cyteth a letter of myne Fol. 64. to ſay the Agency in Wisbich vvas vvithout title, place, and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, it is a fitton.</p>
                  <p>The thing it ſelf sheweth that vppon am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and emulation (for they ſayd they were not honored enough) they ouerthrew the credit of one of the moſte famous places in Europe. The introduction and grownd of the reſt was an Epiſtle vvhich 18. of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvrote to Fa. Gar. beginning, <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tulimus ab heri &amp; nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius tertius &amp;c.</hi> In the English Apol. it is may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and in the latin in the firſt Catalogue of fraudes Num. 14. that parte vvhich is left out is ſayd to be an impoſture of others aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed vntruely to the 18. I did vvonder, at the lightnes &amp; folly of the libeller vvhen I ſavv the tvvoe Catalogues, the one of frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17035:214"/>the other of men abuſed, ſett before the Libell. Scarce a true vvorde is in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, and many notorious vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, but this denying of parte of their epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, is to beare the bell. The letter in the firſt true edition is turned into English (as I hear) vvith a commentary, and is intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Epiſtola prima obſcurorum virorum.</hi> And I knovve ſome vvho at the ſight of it at the beginning ſayd, they vvould neuer conſort with the Ageniſts for the abſurdity of that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It may be novv they ſee they ſpoke truer then they vvould vvhen they affirmed Fat. VVeſton to be a paralytik in his bed not able to vvalke, <hi>in via Iuſtorum,</hi> in the way of the Iuſt. And they muſt needes perceiue that the remedy for him vvas as ridiculous and puppish as their conceipt, that they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riled the hovvſe and lett him dovvne in a couch before his Superior. And if he had bin a vvhole man, yet he vvalked another way then his ſuperior preſcribed ſince. His letter to me is auouched vvherein he ſaythe he vvas neither author, nor counſaylor, not approuer of the ſeparation. And it may be they ſee vvhen men perceiue by their ovvne confeſſion, they pulled of the tyles of the hovvſe, they may doubt whether they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to pull dovvne all the reſt. When I ſavv ſo egregious an vntruthe and deniall of a thing moſte notorious in the beginning, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17035:214"/>all the reſt ſutable (a very bundle of lyes) I determined to referre men to the English narration of wisbich matters, vvhich hath vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neceſſity ſparingly ſett out ſome things, though it hath paſſed many other worthy the knowing. Tvvoe vntruthes may not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched proceeding of ſplene and malice, to obfuſcate the eſtimation of tvvoe Prieſts, the one dead the other aliue. The dead is M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Norden vvho vvith me is made to haue drawen M. Bluett to oppoſition againſt Fath. Weſton, and ſo to haue cauſed the diſſention. Beſides that M. Bluett is of that vvorthineſſe, vertue and iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that he vvould be drawn to nothing but that vvhich is right: it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly knovvne that the ſeparation vvas made before D. Norden came. His diſlike of it proceeded from many cauſes, vvhereof one vvas: the night before he came to the caſtle, remayning in Wisbych tovvne vvith his keeper of London from vvhence he vvas remooued, one of the ſeparators (vvhoſe name I ſpare) vvrote him a letter conteyning the names and prayſes of the ſeparators, and ſundry detractions againſt thoſe vvhich kept their former vnity, and a perſuaſion to him therefore to be one of the ſeparation. The next day for fear he should be ſearched, he burnt the letter before he came to be priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Caſtle. In proceſſe of tyme ſeing many the like vnprieſtly trickes of the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17035:215"/>he grevv to great diſlike and open plain reprehenſion of them, eſpecially for that they ſpoke and vvrote euill of others, alleaging among other proofes the letter Written to himſelf. The party vvho vvrote it knovving it to be burnt, denyed it in ſuch ſorte that D. Norden affirming it vppon his Prieſthood, charged the other to be a flatt Atheiſt. Many ſuch things he charged the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited vvith, as F. Weſton himſelf and Archer, vvith auerring and defending the ſtevves to be as lavvfull as the Pope himſelf, the denial of vvhich propoſitions in this Apology is ſo vvithout the compas of humane modeſty, as it ſeemeth a very league vvith hell againſt truthe and honeſty, for ſaluing the credit of F. Weſton and his complices: a ſtrange and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueillous kinde of death muſt be aſcribed to D. Norden, vvho yet as he had euer liued ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ſyncere, ſo he dyed in priſon for the confeſſion of his fayth of an Appoplexy, in quiet and Chriſtian manner, referring his cauſe to be diſcerned by God betvvixt him and his factious detractors, vvho are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent onely to rake in all the cannels of the liuing, but needes muſt be ranſaking the graues of the departed, vvho if they cannot diſcommend, yet vvill conceale, or as much as they can diſſemble due commendations. In the booke to his Holineſſe in diſcribing the ſtirres of Wisbich it is ſayd: <hi>There came a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17035:215"/>certain prieſt to bring almes to the impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, &amp;c.</hi> In the firſt Catalogue of the latin booke. Num. 18. Theſe prayſes are ſayd to be giuen to M. Mush. If it vvere a miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to putt M. Mush for M. Doleman, it vvere a ſtrange boldneſſe of him that would write any thing out of the authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls (as he calleth them) ſo much to erre in the narration of one of the chiefeſt points of the matter: and by this one may ſee what wiſe information the author of the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie had, and what creditt is to be giuen to all the reſt of his tale. If it were of purpoſe (as othervviſe it vvas a dull ouerſight) it could not be leſſe then enuy againſt M. Dolman, a man as it is vvell knovvne of ſingular ſollicitude tovvards afflicted Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and of long tyme a ſpeciall prouider for priſoners, in vvhich reſpect he vvas and is a great moate in the Ieſuits way, which are ſayd to ſeeck themſelues and not Chriſte or his. The mention of M. Dolman is made in the booke to the Pope, to shevv Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in ſending him to Wisbich ſo opportunely, to be an Arbiter of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, vvho vvas a man beſydes his rare charity of ſuch experience iudgement and ſyncerity as none fitter could haue been choſen, whereby the peruicacity of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated may more be conuinced, vvho vvould not deſiſt at the compaſſionate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſuaſion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17035:216"/>perſuaſion and teares of ſo vvorthy a man, nor for the aduice of other excellent men vvhom he had conferred vvithall, nor at the laſte as they had promiſed (at his vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the arbitrement at their requeſtes) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and vndertaken and vvere in conſcience bound vpon his ſentence giuen that they could not go forvvard vvithout ſinne. And therefore no maruayle though the libeller vvould haue that ſeem to be ſpoken of M. Mushe, vvhich could be ment of none but M. Dolman. The vvhole narration no leſſe foolish then maliciouſe, I leaue to any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and Chriſtian iudgement. At the cloſe I am charged vvith a contradiction for vvriting to Father Garnet in commendation of Father Weſton, vvhome elſvvhere I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. The truthe vvas, Father Garnet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded Fa. Weſton (vvho had been cauſe of much troobles and ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dalls) ſo that there might be a formed peace to deſiſt from his Agency in his letters to me, my ſelf M. Mush and M. Dudley dealt vvith him, he vrged the making of ſome rules which he thought could neuer have been procured, yet they were contented vnto. That vvay being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued he pretended a great deſire of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation vvhich he knevv to be difficult, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the iniuryes and detractions procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from him and his, to the preiudice of the others, yet vvith great difficulty we obtayned

Being thus driuen from all hope of retayning his dominion, he deſired that he might haue the credit of perſwading his partye to reunite them ſelues by making to them an exhortation, in pronouncing where of he fell downe amongſt them, and at the firſt was thought to be dead: howſoeuer the libeller would haue it thought to be a fiction, which is a manifeſt ſigne of want of honeſty and grace in the libeller. At length after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tergiuerſations, a tyme and place, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for the reuniting of all agayn. In which aſſembly F.

                  <p> This Fisher at his comming to Rome was brought to the Colledge, and impriſoned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cuſtody of the common iaylor, for that office he executeth, and as it ſeemeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth. Being in cloſe keeping (as I of certain knowledg, doe knovv he himſelf relateth it &amp; promiſeth to iuſtify before his Hollineſſe) Once for a shevv Acariſius came to examin him, but ordinarily his keeper Fa. Parſons offering to put hott Irons to his armes, if he would not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe what he would haue him. Theſe tymes God hath reſerued vs into, wherein our English College fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by our kings for the good of our country, should be poſſeſſed by thoſe vvho make it a place of impriſonment and torture. A number of sheets of paper vvere vvritten of tales, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and incoherent lyes, vvhich is one of the moſt principall authenticalls of the libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. And if there vvere nothing elſe, that is a ſufficient diſcouery of the packing of Fishers confeſſion, and of much malice elſe, that he maketh him, fol. 96. to ſay, he vvas principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended to M. Chriſt. Bagshaw, M. Robert Dolman, and M. Iohn Collington. And yett muſt needs this vvorthy vvorke be printed in disgrace of thoſe, vvho are tovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with Fishers confeſſion. If Fishers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports be of any credit, the libeller and his Rovvte be arrand honeſt men. If they be of no credit the publishing of them deſerueth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17035:219"/>a furred capp. Among other narrations of Fishers, a number of incoherent fooleryes, collected vnder his name, one is of ſome great familiarity which he ſaw betvvixt ſome of vs in Wisbich, and the keeper, and alſo the keepers vvife. A detractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to their cuſtome generall, ſovvnding bigg, and a toy in particular diſcuſſion. The libeller hath very bad luck in his Chronology, for M. Medley our keeper his wife was a very olde vvoman, and dead ſome years before Fisher came to Wisbich, yet his cunning is to hurt by a confuſed ſuſpicion if he can, and no man in particular shalbe able to vrge ſatisfaction. I could haue vvished for the honor of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the libeller had not vvith ſo much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthe and improbability, corraded ſuch baſe shew of matter againſt men of knovvne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, for that it diſcouereth very bad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in himſelf (and many things dayly begin to be imputed to his complices, I hear more and more) the diſplaying vvhereof if hereafter it grieue him and them, they muſt thank themſelues, and haue the amends in their hands. I haue heard (and truly diſſvva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) ſome threatning ſuch publication, and I could vvish that the libeller with Harwood &amp; all the reſt of the pack of detractors, vvere vvith their accuſations remitted to Gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, if it vvere not preiudiciall to their ſoules vvhich is much to be feared. One de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17035:219"/>vvith Fisher is not to be omitted. After Fa. Parſons had made him ſay and vnſay vvhat he vvould haue him, he cauſed him (being ſtill garded by ſome of his creatures) to come before ſome of the ſtudents, and tell them in ſolemne earneſt, of his knowledge, that the ſtirres in the Romane Colledge againſt the Fathers vvere cauſed by the Councell of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and therefore to be abhorred. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may be ſeen vvhat vviſe opinions he vvould imprint in our vertuous youthes, vvhat auerſion he beareth and bewrayeth to the ſtate of England, vwhich others ſought to haue concealed, and vppon what grounds he chargeth men vvith dealing vvith the Councell. And yet this ſerued him for a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall grownd to vvrite into Spayn, that the English ſtudents were alienated from the king of Spayn vntill he came to Rome and altered them. By which and a number of like shifts and ſurquedryes, he hath abuſed both England and Spayn, which in due tyme here after may come to the light and laughter of the worlde. And becauſe in the Latin libell he maketh the Councel, or I know not what enemyes, beginners of the diſcontents and garboyles in Rome, and vvould dravv a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn cohaerence of the late ſtirres vvith things which fell out in my tyme, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me expelled thence by the Cardinalls ovvne hands vvhereof I neuer heard before.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17035:220"/>I redd the libell nor know not now vvhat it meaneth. I muſt ſay ſomething of my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of Rome. Although to be expelled thence, or from any place for that vvhich he calleth ſedition, be to be counted I doubt not reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and merit, (which if he had or durſt haue explicated in particuler vvhat he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by ſeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,) would more eaſily appear. For any act or worde of myne in Rome or els vvhere let him obiect vvhat he can, I giue him leaue, &amp; in iuſt defence of myne honor, I defy all ſuch contemptible companions, as shall any vvay oppoſe themſelues againſt it. But to clear the myſts which he caſteth. Being made Prieſt in Fraunce, with that freedome and reſolution for England, with which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent and innocent Prieſts had bin made before, I went to Rome, to viſit that holy and renowned place, with leaue and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the late Cardinall Allen of happy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, to ſtay or return according to myne owne liking, for vvhich and many other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours I was ſingulerly beholding to that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. At my firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to Rome, ſeing the ſtate of the Colledge, the number of the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and that for notoriouſe iniuryes, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to return agayn with the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. Which reſolution I vvould neuer after alter, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g many other cauſes, for that I had gotten the Italian payn in the breſt in taking the ſpirituall exerciſe in the Romane
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17035:220"/>Colledge for vvhich I vvas driuen for a tyme to liue in our vinyeard, and vſe other meanes of recouery, but all in vayn, for which and other cauſes, Cardinall Allen wrote vnto me to come into Fraunce. Whileſt I was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting opportunity of returning, D. Levvis Bishop of Caſſana came to Rome, and lay in the College, vſing often conference with me about English matters. Fa. Agazarius kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vving moſte of the ſtudents to dislike his proceedings, and doubting that he should be driuen out of the hovvſe (vvhich fell out immediately after in Sixtus Quintus his tyme vpon a viſitation vvhich was procured after my departure, vvherin M. D. Ely hath bin misinformed, as though I had bin one of the procurers of that viſit) dealt vvith me very earneſtly, that I vvould reſolue to ſtay and be intirely vnited with the Fathers. My anſwear to him and others vvas ſtill reſolute for departure. The fashion of the Ieſuits is to haue one vvhoſe name they may vſe for their diſignes, to the end things laudible may be attributed to themſelues, and things diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable to him. So vvas Cardinall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ietane for their matters of England, and ſo vvas at that tyme Cardinall Boncompagno, vvhom vvith no credit to himſelf (to ſay the leaſt) the libeller nameth, nor vvith honor to the Cardinall, but that he vvould play ſmale game rather then ſitt out. The Cardinall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17035:221"/>asked me vvhether I vvould ſtay, and I tolde him no, the Cardinall ſayd then I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to departe, I anſvvered rather that day preſent then the next. After this vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I came to the Pope himſelf of bleſſed memory Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the 13. he moued my ſtay vnto me, I anſvvered his Holines, I had a firm reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go to my country, vvhere vppon he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed me vvith the reſt, vvith moſt fatherly vvordes and affection, and graunted all the requeſts vve propoſed vnto him. And F. Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarius gaue ſuch teſtimony to me and others then departing vnder his hand and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege ſeale, vvhich is yet extant to be ſeen, as if the libeller had vievved it, call he ſedition vvhat he liſt (his calling not being vvorth a blevv point) he vvould confeſſe our expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (if any had bin) to be moſt iniuriouſe, &amp; vvith no aduantage to the libeller remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. The records of the College be nothing but foolish partiall vvreſting and reporting of things according to priuate humors, vvhich is at length grovvne to that narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mother Hubberd, vvhich I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in the beginning. Within the compaſſe of vvhich ſince, he vvill needes dravv his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of Oxon, the conference of one parte vvith another vvill diſcouer the whole. For. Parſons his departure out of Oxon he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a tale vvithout head or feet that becauſe he vvould haue punished on M. Iames Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17035:221"/>his owne ſcholler for going to a play, I ioyned vvith the Proteſtant party, vvhoe vvould needs throw him and all his out of the College the ſame night, except he would yeald to departe. If he had not a marueilous conceypt of his ovvne vvitt, he vvould not vtter ſuch narrations, not onely voyd of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance but of all probability or colour of truthe. Long tyme he hath bin ſuffered to reporte, that he was putt out of Oxon for his Religion, vvith ſome touch of credit to me and others, vntill at length his exorbitant grating vpon euery one vvho ſtood in his way, gaue ſome occaſion by ſome inſinuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the truthe to giue him a caueat, not to be ſo ſawcy in medling vvith other mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſo farr ſo forget his ovvne imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                  <p>True it is that M. Squier did not like M. Parſons, but that he did obiect any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler matter againſt him is ſo farre from truthe, that he made proteſtation to the contrary. For Religion M. Parſons then did profeſſe himſelf a Proteſtant and that vvith ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, as he dealt with M. Squire for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in the ſtudy of diuinity, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred ordinarily in the reading of Caluin with M. Hyde, a fellow in the hovvſe, a knowne Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſt, but othervviſe learned and a very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Gentleman. Yea being burſar he had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnished the College library of many aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17035:222"/>bookes, and rare manusſcripts (and of ſome of them as is thought dishoneſtly) and in their ſteed brought in a number of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall bookes the firſt that euer were there vvhich yet remayn for an argument of his want of Religion, and for a corraziue to his conſcience vvhyleſt he liueth. The reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſome of the fellovves to be ridd of him vvas ſuch, that they had prouided the tolling of a bell for him as the manner is for one vvhich is to departe the vvorlde, vvhich as it might proceed from ſome diſcompoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo I proteſt before God I did not know of vntill I heard the bell toll, and there vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> asked the cauſe. He had indeed the fauour graunted him to reſigne (being firſt lavvfully expelled) his ſubmiſſion vvith many teares &amp; promiſe to vs all vvhoe vvear there that he vvould euer after cary himſelf in good ſorte. That he hath borne malice tovvarde me, I am ſory he hath giuen ſuch cauſe to think, as in the libell is vttered, and I could haue vvished that his vertue had obliterated all thoſe things which then paſſed, and that he had not by his comporteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſince, loſt thoſe good motions vvhich his humiliation cauſed him to vtter then. For being charged in Oxon amongſt very many things (vvhich I vvould be loath to vtter) vvith forgery by one Sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kliffe his fellovv burſar, it ſeemeth ſtrange to me that in this libell mention is made of ſo many things, vvhich muſt needs be foyſted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17035:222"/>(as Fishers memoriall Fishers confeſſion, for a great parte, my letters deliuered in Millan) and amongſt many other one fol. 135. <hi>And vvhich is further</hi> (ſayth the libeller) <hi>it vvas diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by tht ſame papers and other letters out of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland that they had particuler deſignements to make themſelues Bishops and Archbishops</hi> (ſpeaking of D.

                  </p>
                  <p>And not vnlike is the narration of M. Iames Hauley his going to a play, and keeping in my chamber for fear of correction, as he is novv a Gentleman of great vvorth and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, ſo was he in his yong yeares of rare expectation and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſed behauiour. I doubt not but M.

And therefore I maruell at his boldenes in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning him but much more in remembring the matter of eating flesh, except he vvould regiſter his ovvne perpetuall infamy.

Since tvvoe or three lavvfull appeals made to the ſea Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolik (vvhich are acknowledged in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy) his authority (if euer he had any) being ſuſpended, it vvas a playn rebellion againſt Gods Church in him to medle further to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as much and as dispightfully as he could all appellation, to oppoſe himſelf againſt the Vniuerſity of Paris, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne the learning, practiſe, and canons of the vvhole Churche (a fevv co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plices of his ovvne excepted) &amp; to make himſelf in his ovvne cauſe a ſupreme, peremptory, infallible and inappellable iudge. The moſt Reuerend Bishop of Trica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica Viceprotector of England vvrote vnto him to ſee all things reſtored <hi>in integrum.</hi> His deſpicable anſwear shevveth vvhat indeed his regard of the Popes deputyes is, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of the Pope himſelf. We vvrote vnto him from Framingham of diuers falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations which he vſed in cyting our letters,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17035:224"/>vvhereof one vvas, vvhich is recyted agayn in the Apologie fol. 82. that he should ſend 2200 pounds to Flanders. Is not this an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vvorld vvhen an vntruthe shalbe auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, noted, iterated, corrected, and yet agayn and agayn repeated? ſpecially in a matter of ſuch iniquity as is the indeuoring to ſtarue the confeſſors of Chriſte in priſon. Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice (wherevnto beſides a number of like intollerable grieuances to the Saynts of God M. Blakvvell hath concurred) cannot be counteruayled in Gods iudgement or an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauteriated conſcience with a vayn, vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, daungerous, and ſurrepted title.</p>
                  <p>F. Parſons vvho ſtandeth ſo much in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology vpon his booke of reſolution, I vvish not the diminution of commendations due to his labour (althogh it be nothing ſo much as he vvould haue the vvorld beleeue) but his continuance in handeling that obiect. As to ſome priuate friends of his, ſome yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res agoe talking vvith me about the myſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes of the Churche of England, and ſygni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying they heard ſome vvere about to ſett out Parſons life I then tolde, that I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood many vvere exaſperated vvith him for diuers and iuſt cauſes, and knovv no reaſon vvhy they should ſpare him, and therefore vvished he vvould leaue of with detractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; practizings to irritate men: ſo in one commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> letter vvhich in the Apol. he ſayth vvas to be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17035:225"/>shewed to the Pope, we gaue a ſufficient ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat <hi>Cito indignabitur libertas ſi opprimitur.</hi> or as he eyteth it (if truly) fol. 18. <hi>ſi prematur.</hi> That vvhich he should haue taken for a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to him ſelf he maketh a matter of excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation againſt vs (ſaith he) <hi>theſe good liber tines. &amp;c.</hi> And I know not vvhether ſome of them from vvhome it proceeded will ſay, ſee this calumniator, ſee this ignorant cenſurer, ſee this vnlearned Atheiſt. They be the wordes of S. Hier. in his Epiſtle to Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Patriarch of Alexandria, againſt Iohn Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Hieruſalem, and now Ariſtippus vvill make S. Hierome a libertine, I know not how farr in rigor his reprehenſion may be drawen in ſpeaking againſt defence of liberty, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eccleſiaſticall.</p>
                  <p>Is not ſuch a mans talke of peace like the ſpeach of frier Rush after he had ſet all by the eares. He wrote I knovv letters to M.

And I am vvitnes that all three moſt ſincerely and charitably indeauored to procure peace, offering all reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and more then vvas fitt. M. Colling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton at the firſt comming of the brief came to Wisbich and vppon his conſcience proteſted, that he thought M. Blackvvells authority vvould do good to England (a great induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for quieting things then) vpon fayre wordes and promiſes made to him and M.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17035:225"/>Mush by M. Blakvvell, vvherein of M. Blak. ment truly as is thought then and of him ſelf he did, he hath bin egregiouſly abuſed and transported ſince. If he ment fraudulently (vvhich the euent might perſuade) he is as faythles a man as liueth vppon the earth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things he promiſed the return of D. Bishop and M. Charnok the reſtoring of facultyes to M. Benſon, M. Hill, and M. Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and diuers other things in particuler which he knovveth, beſides a generall &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable atonement for all matters paſſed.</p>
                  <p>Nothing was performed but new picking of olde quarrells (vvhich the Pope in his laſte brief ſayth he ſorrovvfully repeateth) Heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon a nevv and vvorſe trooble ariſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the requeſts, letters, and caueats of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to M.

Wright and others vvitneſſed M. Blakvv. promis made to them in London, that all olde quarrels should be buried, M.

                  <p>Herevppon the Appeale vvas forced and the vvant of conſcience in the libeller diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, vvhich pretendeth I knovv not vvhat compact vvith the Councell to make the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, and yet not intent to proſecute it, one being as true as the other, and both shameles and vvitleſſe ſurmiſes, vvhich kynde of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling if he continue in, he shal deſerue in ſteed of a redd capp a blevv whetſtone.
